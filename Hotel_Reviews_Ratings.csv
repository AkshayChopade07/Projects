"We have stayed at this excellent hotel before and had hoped to stay again today. However, due to negative changes in Covid numbers and impending government restrictions, we felt reluctant to visit. On phoning this morning and being advised that we could still check in under the new rules, when I expressed concern it was dealt with in the kindest and most efficient manner. We cannot wait to return to Hotel de France and experience the fabulous spa and fantastic Saffron’s Restaurant again. Thank you for your exemplary and excellent customer service. 😊",5
"We had a fantastic overnight staycation to recharge the batteries due to lack of holiday in 2020! It certainly did that. Had a swim in the spa (probably the loveliest pool in Jersey, infinity pool, subdued blue lighting and perfect temperature). Plenty of space in the spa area too. This was followed by a fantastic 3 course meal in the Garden View restaurant. All the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is spotlessly clean and usual protocols for Covid are in place, making you feel safe. Christmas decorations are up making the hotel feel warm and welcoming. I would highly recommend the hotel, thank you for a lovely weekend 😀",5
"We chose this hotel for an overnight stay based on the pool facilities and having a 4 year old who loves swimming. After just 15 mins in the pool on a Sunday morning, we were told to keep the noise down!! We had to get out as it’s impossible to keep a 4 year old quiet when they’re having fun! From a family perspective, Spa / pool is 1 out of 5, which is a shame as they are nice facilities. Food was 5 out of 5, and room nice too - overall therefore, from a family perspective, I rate this hotel 3/5... stay elsewhere if you want to have fun in the pool!!",3
"Really nice hotel, staff were very helpful and friendly. They were all wearing masks which was reassuring as they don't seem commonplace (as at September 2020). The cleaners did a great job. Food was outstanding",5
"We stayed here for a week in September and really enjoyed out stay. The staff were very friendly and took covid19 precautions very seriously so helping us to relax and enjoy our stay. The room and hotel were very clean and again covid 19 precautions like wipes and hand sanitiser were plentiful. We ate in hotel for dinner on two occasions and the food was very good. Like I said before the staff were very friendly and this from the very beginning at the point of booking to the time we booked out, they were friendly and always willing to answer any questions and the wine, flowers and fruit on our anniversary were a really nice touch. Thank you all for making our stay relaxing and enjoyable and we will be back.",5
"During the Covid 19 crisis the trick for hotels and hospitality businesses is to create a clean safe environment whilst helping clients to enjoy themselves in as normal environment as possible.  Not an easy trick to pull off but the Hotel de France carries it off well.  As part of their Covid regime everyone has their temperature taken on an automatic monitor on the way to reception every time they enter or re enter the hotel which is very reassuring.  Room cleaning is flexible and easy to arrange what you wish to have done every day under Covid regs.    The hotel is well appointed and clean.  With easy parking if you hire a car. Our room was in the new section.  It was modern, large, had a great view over St Helier, and a small balcony which fitted two seats and a table…",5
"Stayed at this hotel 5 times in 7 months for business, the staff and hotel have me me very welcome each time.From arriving at check in you are made very welcome, from extras like news papers, use if spa, to the two restaurant options, very well presented and the food options are great.",5
This hotel offered outstanding service from start to Finnish. Myself and my partner only stayed for one night in room 246 for our anniversary. I felt the service from front of house when you arrived to the bar and Spa was outstanding. The facilities in the Spa are well worth the visit. We did not want to go home. Thank you for great memories and a excellent stay.  From Caroline and James ,5
"We stayed for a week in July and wasn't disappointed! The hotel is amazing, members of staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and nice, good choice of tea/coffee/hot chocolate. Shampoo/shower gels were very good quality.   Breakfast - amazing! We were very well looked after by lovely members of staff. Food was fresh and delicious.   Lunch -  on the terrace, a very peaceful atmosphere, excellent service. Milkshakes were delicious!   Dinner - during the week there is a good venue, seafood was fresh, BBQ on Thursday evening was so good!   Also, it is easy to get to the centre from the Hotel, as they take you there for free a few times a day.   SPA was excellent, sauna, steam room etc. and a really peaceful outdoor area!   We absolutely love Jersey and coming to…",5
"14 of us spent the most wonderful afternoon at The Hotel de France indulging in afternoon tea in their lovely garden restaurant. My friend organised this for me and said the staff we second to none. On the day they couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. There was lots of space and comfortable seating. The afternoon tea was one of the best I’ve ever tried. All freshly made cakes and scones, tasty sandwiches and well presented. I highly recommend it. Thank you again",5
"The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and the effects of this are not made clear on their web-site. They say that the refurbishment will be complete by the end of March but fail to say that until then; there is no restaurant and the bar is closed. You are offered the Garden View restaurant which is no better than a cafeteria, and the part of the restaurant that overlooks the garden is full of junk. The bar is simply part of the spa area and not what you should expect from a four star hotel. Don't book here unless you understand the situation, at least until the refurb is complete.",2
"What a lovely Hotel, elevated so you have great views over St Helier, you can walk in to the City Centre takes about 15 mins but worth the walk, plenty of free parking at the Hotel,  bedroom very spacious with good quality bathroom and the hotel offers one of the best spa's facilities I have been to extremely clean and tidy, staff very polite and accommodating. We hired a fiat 500 for the 3 days which was enough to get round the island, petrol cheaper than the UK, you can also use English money. So bottom line, nice hotel, nice people and great location",5
"My wife and I have been travelling to Hotel DeFrance for many years. Always enjoying our wedding anniversary. A warm welcome by the reception team.  A great hotel with fantastic helpful staff across all areas of the hotel, the staff are always there to help with a smile. This year Saffron’s Hotel closed earlier for the season and the Orangery was closed this impacted on our stay (hence 4 and not 5 stars, this generally hits 5 across the board). Having said that we will be returning; we just think this is an excellent hotel.",4
"we have just returned from 4 nights at this hotel.  My wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The restuarant is excellent, the spa is very good, and most of the staff are all extremely polite, good at what they do, and make you feel completely at home. The rooms are large and airy, the bathrooms are fine. The beds are extremely comfortable.",5
"The balcony rooms are superb, spacious with a view across the rooftops to the sea. The bathroom is large with a walk-in shower and underfloor heating. Sited in the same modern building as the spa, it was very quiet and very clean. Only oddity was the slow lift with a strange lurch when you get in. Definitely recommend a balcony room.  The spa is wonderful with a large area to relax in around the various pools. Breakfast was good and the staff very friendly.",5
"I had attempted to book rooms at this hotel for a group of 4 friends, through a booking site, without success, so I decided to contact the hotel directly, which proved to be the best move I made! The man I spoke to was SO helpful, and we ended up with a double room each, with a lovely view, and they were so all really clean and so comfortable! The hotel had a relaxed and relaxing atmosphere, and from the first time we spoke to the reception staff, until the time we left, everyone was so friendly, and could not do enough for us. Unfortunately I did not eat in the restaurants, apart from breakfast, which was really well presented with loads of choice. I'll certainly be back, and would be really happy to recoomend this hotel to anyone who wants a hotel in St Helier.",5
"Spent a very pleasant three night stay in this splendid hotel. The impressive facade of the building gives you an insight to what you can expect when you step inside. The large reception area is imposing and staffed by friendly, helpful people. We were initially booked in for two nights and our first room was large and comfortable with its own balcony with a view across the St. Helier skyline. There was a wonderful bathroom with a walk in shower. Due to impending bad weather our ferry crossing was cancelled and rescheduled so we had to request an extra night, which the lady in reception kindly arranged. We had to move rooms, this one was equally well furnished with an extremely large bed. There was a good selection for breakfast each morning and we eat in the Garden View…",5
"My third visit to this hotel and I have never been disappointed.The hotel is spacious with wide and long corridors and so never has the feeling of busy! Restaurants and bar, reception, salon and access to the Spa is on two floors. Breakfast which my favourite meal of the day, was always very good with a good selection and the staff efficiently replenished trays and cleared tables. We ate a couple of times in the Garden View Restaurant and again food and service was good. The Spa is superb, with different pools, steam room and sauna. Clearly popular with the locals as everyday I turned up, someone was buying Spa vouchers. Unfortunately, I had a bad limp during the visit and did not venture out into the gardens but could see them from our room. Our room and bed were all very…",5
"We returned to the Hotel de France after 30 years, revisited this hotel with fond memories, obviously there have been changes and improvements, especially to the spa. We had a wonderful room with a balcony of views over the town and sea. It was very clean, spacious and we had everything we needed. Great shower and bath.  We were surprised on our return to find flowers, prosecco and fruit from the hotel. How special that was. The staff were always polite, friendly and professional. Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice for everyone. Great coffee machine too.  Thank you for making our stay so special. We hope we can return again soon, perhaps in the summer months.",4
"Lovely friendly staff, rooms spacious and clean. Quiet and calm hotel. Walking distance to town centre. Food fantastic. Spa facilities amazing. Shuttle bus into town was handy.  Outdoor patio area with comfy furniture to sit and have a drink or food and lawn area with sun loungers to enjoy the sun.  Staff always on hand to help you with anything.",5
"Four colleagues and I stayed at the Hotel de France for just one night. Excellent hotel in a great location with a superb restaurant, Saffrons within. Perfect menu, great choice of wines and spot on service. Will stay there again the next time we visit.",5
"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights earlier this month. When you walk into the hotel, you do feel like you are walking into a 4 star hotel. It is very glamorous and the spa is amazing however the rooms are so outdated and in need of renovation to fit their 4 star rating. The rooms are so simple I would compare it to a standard travel lodge or premier in. The food in the morning never changed and it became quite boring after 4 days. We also had lunch in the hotel which I would not recommend. I had a wrap which was tasteless and the chips were Luke warm. In hein sight we would have been better off somewhere else as the price we paid was definitely not worth the room/food.",3
"I stayed with my fiancé for the weekend in September.   Pros:  The is a very pretty hotel; we had a very large room, which had a big bathroom and a very pretty view. The Spa was excellent with really lovely facilities. It is well located and easy to get to- we walked back to the hotel from the harbor very easily one afternoon.   Cons:  Breakfast seemed poor compared to other hotels of a similar value. There were no clean glasses for juice and the range of food was limited.  We were treated very poorly by the night staff when we came in late one night. We were quizzed on our room numbers, guests names etc- pretty much inferring that one or the other of us had picked the other up in town for a bit of fun! (which was reiterated by the manager we complained to who said they did it…",2
"I stayed at the Hotel De France for two nights in a single room. Getting to the hotel from the airport requires two buses - or one if you walk from the bus station with your case which would take about 25 minutes with the final stretch being up steep steps. Other guests told me they paid £23 for a taxi from the airport (at a busy time). You can get the hotel shuttle bus into town and there is a bus stop outside but I would have preferred a city centre hotel. There are few buses on the hotel route after 6 ish. The single room on the second floor was quiet and clean and had everything that was needed. I have noticed the very positive reviews of the spa- I wish I had visited it. There was no information regarding the spa in my room. So finally, perhaps this is a particularly good…",3
"Pool area surpasses expectation, loved it especially massage pool. Food from the Garden View restaurant was always good quality with nice service. Room was adequate, not luxury. The lounge bar had the surliest barman and most awful music, not designed to welcome their clients, very off putting! ",3
"No problem with our room it had everything that we needed.Breakfast was disappointing.Only milk on offer was full fat.We had to queue to use the machine for tea and coffee.Not what you would expect from a 4* hotel.The food provided in the Garden restaurant was of very poor quality ,limited choice on the menu and expensive. When I booked I did mention that we were celebrating my husband’s 70th birthday.We had no acknowledgement of this.The hotel seemed very impersonal.Our stay was not special.",3
"We decided to book here for a weekend break initially because the price was much more reasonable than the hotels which were recommended to us in central St helier. After driving through St helier on route to the hotel we knew we had made the right choice.  The hotel is spacious, fabulous service and the spa facilities and fitness suite really are the cherry on the top!  A great breakfast selection, drinks menu and spa treatments - if desired at an additional cost.  The walk into town is probably about 15 mins to a vast selection of restaurants or 20 mins to liberation Square.  Definitely a better choice than the busy, squashed hotels on the front. ",5
"Very quick check in for a single room as on business. The room was old fashioned with no view and very small. I would not recommend this size of room as it is not much extra to pay for a double room.  Breakfast had a good selection, however, coffee tasted awful.  Had a meal in the brasserie which was quite good and after that walked into town to different restaurants.  Did not use the spa but it looked very nice and friendly staff.  Was able to sit out on the terrace after work which was pleasant and relaxing.",3
"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this  hotel located on the outskirts of town in St Helier.  We were given a room on the top floor which was rather small and extremely hot with no air con and a pretty useless fan! It didn’t help the temperature was 30 degrees that weekend! However it was kept very clean, the beds were comfortable and they provided tea and coffee making facilities. We ate in the garden view restaurant the first evening as we arrived late. It was lovely to sit outside under the heaters as inside felt more like a cafe. The food was very good here. The breakfast was what you’d expect from a breakfast buffet with lots of choice. The pastries were delicious and very fresh. You had to get your own tea and coffee from the machine but the coffees were as good…",5
"A beautiful hotel, 15 - 20 minutes walk from the centre of St. Hellier. unfortunately we had a rear room so the view was not good but this did not matter as we only slept in it. The public rooms are all very well fitted and it certainly gives off an air of a very expensive hotel without the 5 star price. There is a large terrace where you can relax with drinks or a meal and there is a lovely secluded garden with sun loungers. Food prices, we thought were a bit on the high side so did not eat there but the drinks are reasonable and the complimentary breakfast offered a remarkable choice of hot and cold food from a help yourself buffet. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and they also offer a free…",5
"We went to Jersey for a long weekend stay with my parents. Unfortunately this hotel was not at all what we expected from a 4* hotel. Despite the hotel itself being a very grand and well presented place, the service was disappointing and at times quite unfriendly.   We were given 2 rooms on the top floor which we expected would have beautiful views. My parents had a nice view over St. Helier but our room, overlooked a roof. Nevertheless, the view was the last thing we were worried about as we couldn’t even open our curtains in order to keep the heat out. We could not sleep because of the heat, it was horrible. There was no air conditioning and being in the loft area of the hotel, meant that we were suffocated by the heat. We spoke to the staff at reception who did not seem to…",2
"Staying here at present and from the minute we arrived I thought this is a tired looking hotel.We paid extra for a superior room and it's okay -- but nothing special.The breakfast organisation is really on a par with a Holiday Inn but not quite as good .4 star hotels don't expect their guests to get their own tea and coffee.There is a machine for making toast but it needs replacing  because in order to get something resembling toast and not just warm bread you need to let it go round at least 4 times.Surely they could afford one that actually works.There is an expression ""all fur coat and no knickers"" which really does sum up this hotel.",3
"I had stayed here some years ago and had a beautiful room so was looking forward to returning.  What a shock we got when we saw the dated, cramped room with no view and no air con.  The fan was useless and we were unable to sleep due to the heat.  The carpet was ancient.  The bathroom very dated and poky. For a hotel of this  advertised calibre the rooms do not match and neither do the pictures showing the hotel bedrooms.  These rooms on 3rd floor badly need updating and air con.  However the room was very clean.  The breakfast is good but you have to get your coffee and at times there are queues and the same for the toaster.  The terrace is nice and also the gardens but the hotel is a considerable walk from the centre of St Helier and there is no signage for the hotel so…",2
"There was a fairly strong smell of vomit in our room and, although we were immediately moved, there was no apology from staff.  We asked for a taxi to be booked for our journey to the airport and this was not booked. Again, there was no apology and no sign of urgency despite us repeatedly asking at the desk how long the taxi would be.   Generally the hotel was dated and, in our opinion, undeserving of the 4*. We stayed in a 3* chain hotel the evening before and, if anything, thought it was slightly better. Would not return",2
I booked this through an airline as a single traveller - was quite surprised to see that I had been allocated a single bed and a tiny room. The bathroom was also very small and the sink very low so I wondered if it was for children. If it is I wouldn't put adults in there.I also had an adjoining room which as a solo traveller made me feel a bit nervous. I did not ask for this and wish I had asked to be moved.  The linen on the bed was OK although the pillows were very flat - I asked for another one at reception and offered to take it up with me to be told 'I have to find one first' so not quite sure where they keep their pillows!  The breakfast was OK but the fried eggs were terribly over-cooked and had obviously been sitting there a long time. You also have to do your own tea…,3
"Classed as a 4 star hotel,up a steep hill situated behind a medical centre and and multi story car park, a real shame when the outside of the hotel looked quite impressive. Staff were pleasant and helpful room was ok shower over bath no bath mat and quite slippy to get out of, dangerous if your even a little unsteady. The breakfast room was like sitting in a department store cafe (not a good one) and the breakfast was basic no service for tea and coffee had to queue at coffee machine for too long.  Pool and outside terrace was a lovely area. shuttle bus provided by hotel as a little way from town centre.",3
I stayed here in late July/August with my mother. We had a medical emergency on the night we arrived and I have to say that the hotel reception staff were great. They helped us to get to see a doctor and later moved us rooms so that in the hot weather we had air conditioning. All of the front of house staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The waiting staff in the Garden View restaurant were pleasant and happy to chat. The shuttle bus drivers were always on time and courteous. The bar staff and the staff in Saffron were also very good. Overall I would say that the hotel should be congratulated on the training of their staff as they are a credit to them. The rooms are serviceable and comfortable; cleaned everyday and with the basics that you would want. Food at…,4
"Stayed here for a week  ( business and pleasure). Great room and stunning pool and spa. Staff friendly and attentive. Breakfast room beautiful and wonderful food. Not sure why the star rating isn’t 5?  Although it’s slightly out of the centre, the hotel provides a shuttle bus and the hotel is actually on a bus route.  Great experience we will be back! ",5
booked here in febuary for july few friends had stayed well didn't know what to expect well could not fault  lovely polite staff in fact all staff clean and lovely spacious room with a view an balcony food was excellent ate twice in and lovely tried the spa treatment as a treat for my wife couldn't  fault that either thanks for  a lovely break thank you   ,5
"My husband and I have stayed at the Hotel de France approx. 6/7 times over the years and always enjoyed our visits. However, now our holidays have changed from 'couples holidays' to 'family holidays' we have noticed a big difference. We stayed there last summer for 4 nights and again just last month for 4 nights in the family suite. We cannot fault the hotel for its location, beauty and quality of food but this was our last holiday there as a family. We found over the 4 days the staff only spoke to the children on check-out. Not one member of staff made an effort to speak to the children at breakfast, in the spa and around the hotel in general. In particular the spa/pool area was a very uncomfortable place to come, the staff looked very displeased with the children using the…",3
"This was a girls weekend. The three of us shared a triple bed room. It was spacious, very clean and comfortable. No problems there. But the highlight for us was the pool and the terrace dining. We got lucky with the weather and so spent most of a day swimming and sunbathing. The two pools are big, and although indoors, they look out on the gardens and it’s an easy step outside to the sun loungers. They do not serve drinks or food by the sun loungers which was the only drawback - I do love a frozen pina colada by the pool.  We had several meals on the sun terrace which is very pretty. This is a lovely hotel. ",5
"A really nice hotel set in a quiet location. The staff couldn’t be accommodating enough, especially the front of desk staff.  The wellness facilities were a really nice bonus and my daughter absolutely loved the swimming pools! Parking was excellent as there were no hidden costs and plenty of spaces at all times.  Breakfast buffet was brilliant with great choices!  We will definitely be returning next year!",5
We stayed at the hotel for a short break and so we could have a central base to look around Jersey.  The hotel facilities are great - with a wonderful spa complex and gym.  The swimming pool was warm with massage pools and a cold plunge pool for when you come out of the sauna.  The gardens are magnificent and extremely quiet tucked well away fro the road 300m below the hotel.  We stayed in the new spa wing which had the most comfortable beds and the quietest air conditioning I have experienced (needed with 36 degree temperature in Jersey during our stay!).  The food in the Saffron restaurant was fine dining with an Indian twist - which would cause a problem if you didn't like spicy food (we do and the standard was exceptional).  I think the only criticism I could level would be…,5
"Apart from the steep incline to reach the hotel, I cant fault it! From the best leisure centre & pools I have ever used,  to the excellent food & service, they have thought of everything- even a courtesy bus to & from St Helier! Thank you to all staff!",5
"Stayed here on numerous occasions throughout July 2019.Great hotel, great breakfast options, great room service. Excellent swimming pool many other facilitiesike gym etc but didn't use. Would definetly recommend a stay here for business or pleasure. ",5
Enjoyed a weekend stay there. Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent and staff were very helpful. Only criticism would be no bottled water or easy access to fresh chilled water in the room! ,4
"We have just had 2 night at this fantastic hotel. The atmosphere is relaxed, the hotel is immaculate,  drinks reasonable, breakfast very good.  Staff were all really nice everyone helpful. We stayed for my sister and BIL 20th anniversary and we will never forget it. Prosecco was very much appreciated in hotel room! Helped with lovely weather our stay was just brilliant. We Will all definitely return. Thank you Hotel de France",5
First time at this hotel stayed 4 nights. Very clean hotel. Our room was a good size on the 4th floor with lovely views. The breakfast was plentiful lots of choices. The spa was amazing. Swimming pool was a good size we used the spa every evening. It  is about 15 to 20 minute walk to the town centre or you can catch the shuttle bus. We always walked in to St Helier.,4
"We staid for 2 night. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious with a nice view. Unfortunately no air conditioning in the room.  Breakfast was mediocre, basic but not all to our taste. The line for coffee was endless (2 machines for all +/-200 guests)....as it served also the tea drinkers for hot water. A point to improve.  Location is off center but there is a shuttle service.  Nice place to relax.",4
"This is one of the staple establishment hotels on the island. Well regarded and well run and in a good location. It’s big and has good facilities and food, the staff are very nice and efficient. The gym is especially good and it has a spa there too. Breakfast is well made and relaxed, a bit like most of the island to be honest. My only negative would be dinner. There are 2-3 restaurants in the building all of which are excessively expensive for not excessively good food. There are long tasting menus with about 5 courses that start at £65 per head before drinks then a very limited a la carte menu. If you are vegetarian you will have maybe one to two choices max that weren’t all that great.  The island itself is quite diverse but the food isn’t, if you like English or French or…",4
"Flying visit, to catch up with my son who currently works as a Chef at the Hotel. Hotel excellent, clean, staff friendly and accommodating. Slightly biased but the meals I had were excellent!  Well worth staying there whilst visiting this beautiful island.",5
"I have just stayed here as part of a business trip. My room was large, comfortable and well appointed. I had a lovely big desk whilst I had to work and a sea view to take my mind off it. The hotel itself has an impressive facade, essential revolving door and spacious vestibule with sweeping staircase. You immediately feel that you have been transported to a time where service was still important.  The check in staff were very helpful giving exactly the right amount of help. The provision of a shuttle bus into town is a nice touch. I had a very comfortable night in a huge bed, breakfast was very tasty and offered a wide range to suit all tastes. I would happily stay here again. A really lovely hotel.",5
Just returned from a 9 night holiday at this hotel and absolutely loved it! It’s within a 20 minute walk of st Helier but has a courtesy bus that stops right outside. There’s also a bus stop close by with buses that travel all round the island even quite late. We hired a car so didn’t use them but lots of people we spoke to did. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. We had a few evening meals and lunches in the garden terrace restaurant and loved every one! We also used the spa quite a bit and had two treatments which were amazing. I would say it’s more geared towards adults and was lovely and quiet sitting on the outside terrace. It has a beautiful garden with sun loungers and there are more outside the spa area. If you want peace and relaxation…,5
"I loved absolutely everything about Hotel De France, it was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at.  From start to finish the staff were first class throughout, be that at reception, in the bars and restaurants or even at the gym, I literally have nothing bad to say about them.  The hotel was, as expected, brilliant and the staff took into account my preference for a city-facing room (I was given the rooftop double-room with excellent views over St Helier and beyond).  It was as grand as you see on the information section and I very much liked the Brasserie where I ate for 2 out of the 3 nights I was staying there, with the relaxed settings, optional outdoor seating and BBQ in the summer!  As a solo traveller I did not feel awkward once and the staff were very attentive to…",5
"Location is elevated so the views are good, the standard rooms are on the small side & air con is not standard ! It is what it is.... the decor is dated as a whole & I was advised the spa rooms are the best this hotel can offer.. Now to the best part; The spa itself is a place of tranquil harmony, excellent facilities in good ; well maintained condition. The treatments are professionally delivered by well trained an expert team. Kavita is an exceptional therapist. Could not recommend her highly enough. ",4
"Just back from a week's stay at this lovely hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms very clean. Good selection for breakfast and lovely evening meals. They also have a shuttle bus into town three times a day as it's between a 15 - 25 minute walk into town depending on which way you walk. Would highly recommend.",5
"First time at this Hotel , excellent from the minute we arrived , beautiful building outside and inside ..we stayed in a spa room but extra but well worth it , plenty of space and your own balcony with views over St Helier....The spa was five star , used the pool etc all the facilities twice a day it was amazing so relaxing ... we ate five nights in the garden restaurant good choices, food was very good , service was impeccable  well managed place staff so polite and efficient  as was all the staff at the hotel from reception to the housekeepers so polite, Breakfast was excellent once again good choice and well presented ,overall I would highly recommend this place and would hope without hesitation to book it again on our return to Jersey ,  Thank you for a wonderful stay ....  ",5
"First impression the hotel exterior is very grand, nice reception, friendly staff, then you get to your room.  Very dated decor, single room was not fit for a paying guest more suited to a staff room in an emergency. Window view was a corregated roof, holes in the window blind, no mini bar, no slippers (remember this is a 4 star spa hotel). Shower over a bath. Poor lighting in the room.  Then we get to the breakfast room.  This needs to be shut down for a complete refurbishment.  Turquoise carpet and chairs, orange walls, tatty furniture, all quite depressing.   We had one evening meal in the terrace restaurant, good steaks but served on wooden boards that had seen better days.  We had to tell the kitchen this was a hotbed for bacteria they accepted this and ensured us this…",3
We spent just over a week in the Hotel.  Satisfied with all aspects.  Good sized bed room with bright bathroom.  All clean and well maintained.  Had a few satisfactory meals in the Garden View restaurant.  Nice swimming pool and good sized public rooms.  Bit far out of town so would benefit with more courtesy bus trips.  Breakfast was good but they are in need of one or two more toast machine as the single machine was always a source of congestion.  Also items would often run out and it would take a little time to replenish - more staff needed?  Excellent WiFi throughout the Hotel.  Would be happy to stay again if visiting Jersey.,5
"What a beautiful Chateau-style façade. How on earth did it get hidden on all sides by these rubbish developments? Our room - for a budget break - was perfectly acceptable. We weren't expecting a 'view' and we didn't get one. The public spaces are grand, the staff approachable and the swimming/spa facilities excellent. But oh the abysmal food {breakfast aside}. A ridiculously expensive SouthAsian-style fine dining experience or an overpriced everyday 'bistro' ie fish and chips/burgers. Eat out is my advice.",3
"Great hotel, staff very friendly.  There are only 10 spa rooms which are lovely, even if only a small balcony but adequate, but a great view.  Lots of hanging/storage space and very airy.  Large bathroom with walk in shower and a bath.  Room very convenient for the spa, which is one of the best spa’s I have seen.  Plenty of beds inside and out.  We booked for 7 nights but could only be accommodated in a spa room for 5, but transferred to an executive room for 2 nights. This room is a lot smaller and the wardrobe has virtually no hanging space due to the iron/iron board and also the safe which stands on top of three shelves, also the shower is over the bath. Does have a large sofa and chair and the view is just as good.  Only negative for me is that the dining room decor does not…",4
The exterior and reception area of the hotel are most impressive as are all the public areas it’s just a shame that the rooms are not to quite the same standard. Single rooms are quite small in size with minimal furnishings. Walls are very thin and conversation from adjoining rooms could be clearly heard.  Very expensive to eat or even drink in the hotel as all prices are subject to a 10% service charge which is not advertised although it is discretionary.  Each room is given a voucher for 10% off dining but it can only be used once.  Some of the staff were not the friendliest but the majority were very helpful.  Easy walking distance of the town centre but personally I wouldn’t choose to stay here again. ,3
Stayed at hotel de France to celebrate 60th birthday. Was allocated very nice room and bottle of prosecco on arrival.  Lovely meal in saffron restaurant.  About 20 minute walk to bus station.  Would visit again. ,5
"A typical French decor and ambiance. A history connected to motor racing and maintained. All rooms are named after a famous driver and individually decorated.  Very friendly staff, with nothing too much trouble. Central location for roaming the Loire Valley. 40 minutes by car, across country roads to Tours as an example.",4
"What a magnificent hotel Where do one begin to sing the praises of such a grand hotel, their staff from management to cleaners, waiters, bar staff and to everyone who we met and talked to. You are all an asset to the hotel. Room we stayed in was clean, spacious, Bed comfortable and more of all the bathroom was spotless and the shower was luxurious. Whatever I write will never suffice to describe how lucky we were to have chosen this hotel for the stay. Thanks for the lovely time  Ramsurn Family   ",5
"Recently stayed with family for 3 nights in two inter-connecting rooms on fourth floor.  Although it was only the end of May, the rooms were very warm - the heating was off, the windows were wide open.  No air-conditioning.  I think it would be very uncomfortable in full summer.  The rooms were comfortable and very clean - a bottle of water would be a nice addition.  The bathrooms were very small.    Breakfast is served in the Orangery which was, in contrast, freezing - take a jumper with you!    We only ate breakfast at the hotel - there was an excellent range of food on offer.  The vast majority of the staff were charming - attentive, very helpful.    The spa facilities were lovely - full use of the pool, massage pool and steam room/sauna.  On the couple of days we visited,…",4
"Our 5 night stay at HDF was an absolute delight: far exceeded our expectations. Very comfortable room: charming and helpful staff both front of house, restaurants, in fact everywhere. Food was excellent although we ate mostly in the Garden Room: Saffrons came highly recommended and we must try next visit. Breakffast was excellent. Easy, shortish walk to town centre, but ask reception for quickest route. Hotel provides shuttle bus which runs at regular intervals but not on Sunday",5
"We spent 4 nights here last week in one of the spa rooms  and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The  room was lovely and had a wonderful view over St Helier . The bathroom was lovely and roomy with a wet room shower area. Under floor heating made it very comfortable . We ate in the Garden Restaurant and have to mention Christina who was very helpful and remembered our drinks order from the previous evening. Impressed!  The breakfast room was fine, but it was unfortunate that there were no windows. A bit dark . All the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5
"Having staying at the de France several times before, I contacted the hotel and requested a particular room and thanks to  Dionne Britton, we got the room we wanted.  As usual the service the hotel offers was second to none, and as further proof of that, when we left something in our room after checking out, the hotel arranged for it to be sent on to us. Can't recommend this hotel enough, thank you. ",5
"Our room with a view was very nice. The restaurant on site had excellent service, great food and a quaint atmosphere. The Spa is a very relaxing experience after a day of exploring the island. All hotel staff were friendly and attended to our every request with a positive, helpful attitude. We usually walked to town but did use the shuttle once and it did drop you right in the center of town.  We truly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel de France.",5
"I have just returned from a weekend break with my sisters to the Hotel de France in St Helier Jersey..   We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, the staff could not do enough to help and were extremely friendly .. The rooms were very pleasant, lovely view, beds comfortable..We ate at the Garden View restaurant each night and were impressed with the efficient friendly service there and the food was tasty too.",4
"This is a very good hotel. We had a wonderful large room,with a balcony. There was a very nice bathroom with a large bath and a walk in shower. Very good choice for breakfast,too many items to list. Without exception,all of the staff we encountered were very helpful and cheery. Would absolutely not hesitate to stay again. ",5
"A little too far from the town to walk but the hotel does offer a shuttle bus to and from the centre during the day.  There is much of the old world charm with an interesting history  and beautiful architecture.  The hotel is clean in all areas.  Very appealing, varied and and tasty breakfast (fresh croissants- delicious) with happy staff and the best poached eggs (no water residue and obviously very fresh as the egg yoke was a deep orange yellow).   Views from the hotel at the front looking over St Helier are amazing.    The bar area by the Saffron restaurant is elegant yet cosy.  Reception staff excellent with warm professional welcome.  I would definitely stay in this hotel again as I didn't get a chance to use the spa and pool which looked amazing.    ",5
"I was here for a couple of days on business and was very impressed; luxurious room and setting, good facilities, very helpful staff, good food, wonderful swimming pool/spa complex.  Highly recommended and good value.",5
"Being an older ‘hen’ we wanted relaxation and comfort.  We got this and more.  The hotel is beautifully decorated, very clean and all the staff went above and beyond and were the best.  Their customer service is exceptional from front of house to the maid service.  Plenty to do and plenty of space to not be on top of everyone.  Spa facilities exceptional.  We will be back.  Well done Hotel de France",5
"This Hotel has it all. The location is perfect. It’s within easy reach of St Helier town centre,and has a dedicated free shuttle to take you there at set times during the day.  The rooms are incredible. The beds are very large and comfortable with all the essentials.  The bathroom is magnificent and the views are incredible.    The food was by far the best of the lot. Breakfast each morning is very generous it’s self service and everything was always fresh and of the highest quality.    I particularly recommend the garden view. It’s food was simply perfect. The staff were amazing and each and everyone was hugely professional and friendly   We are already looking forward to our next visit here and will be planning it very shortly. 10/10. We can’t recconend this hotel highly…",5
"The good:-  Hotel and room was spotlessly clean, parking was good, Pool facilities are great. A good range of TV channels but not all of the standard free view/freesat available. About 20 channels in all. Bed was comfortable (medium) and clean and the hotel food was good enough (if a little overpriced)  in the garden view restaurant, was a little put off from that from trying Saffrons as at the prices charged in Saffrons you do not really want to come away feeling disappointed or that it was overpriced, Staff friendly and helpful, adequate range of coffee tea ,making facilities in the rooms, no complimentary water though - and thank goodness, a hotel with the forethought to provide you with a loo brush in the bathroom should the need for it arise... Fairly decent complementary…",3
We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel de France and will definatley return. The rooms are spotless and ALL the staff are really friendly. The food was a good standard and the pool area was really relaxing..,5
"My husband and I booked to stay for one night to finish off our fabulous break to Jersey and we weren't disappointed! We arrived early and a little soggy and were pleased to hear our room was ready and we could book in early. Our room was clean and warm and had everything we needed for our stay. We ate twice in the garden view restaurant and the food and service was excellent. The spa is one of the best we've been to and even after checking out we could use the facilities to freshen up for our journey home. The staff were all extremely friendly, efficient and helpful and on our last trip on the shuttle bus to town nothing was too much trouble which finished our holiday off perfectly. Thank you Hotel de France for a perfect end to our holiday, we hope to come back one day!",5
Spar gift voucher expired horrible experience. The hotel keep the money paid for from the person buying the gift voucher and embarrass the receiver of the voucher when they ask to use it. Dont buy Hotel De France Spar Gift Vouchers for people you care about. You could end up losing your money and giving your loved ones a bad experience.,1
"We stayed four nights on a Secret Escapes deal. The first night we spent in a very bijou room on the 5th floor up in the 'attic'. It was beautifully decorated but so warm - even in February! I was disappointed as the website advertises air conditioning - but obviously not on the 5th floor. We were consequently moved to the 2nd floor and a larger room.  This did have air-con but wasn't needed as the temperature of this room was 'normal'.  Bed was comfortable, good quality bed linen and good quality towels.  Bathroom was very dated but shower was hot and powerful with luxury toiletries. Bathrobes were also included. As another review has stated Hotel de France is more of a classic and I tend to agree - the rooms were not modern.  However, the spa area and gym (according to my…",4
"Our room was on the 1st floor,very quiet and near the lifts. Beautifully clean,lovely bed,lovely bathroom with fluffy towels. Large wardrobe for clothes,and safe. The food was amazing,and good portions. Breakfast,lots of choice..full english,eggs benedict,fresh fruit,and lots of pastries yum!! Evening meal,Lamb shank,fish and chips,Black butter sausage,mash and onion rings, and much more..fab!! The staff were all lovely. Be careful though if you go on their courtesy bus,that you take your phone and the hotel number...we made the mistake of leaving our phones,the bus was to pick us up at 2pm...no one came...we asked a lovely lady named Lucy if she would ring the hotel and find out where they were..this was at 2.30pm..they said they would be along shortly....gone 3pm,the bus came…",5
We stayed at the Hotel De France for two nights with a family group. The rooms were spacious and well equipped. The pool and spa area was beautiful. Towels and robes were provided and sunbeds if you wanted to lounge. We ate twice in the Garden Restaurat there was a good selection and the price was reasonable.  The breakfast was also very good. The staff were friendly and attentive.  Jersey is a beautiful Island and we enjoyed exploring with our hire care.,5
We stayed just one night in this hotel. The spa facilities are top class. We only used the pool and steam areas. Lots of treatments available should you want them. The room was clean and well stocked with amenities. We had a lovely view as can be seen in the picture. It's only a 10min walk into town so don't let the non central location put you off. All the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for you. The breakfast was also very good with lots of cooked items and fresh cut fruit. We would return to this hotel in a heart beat. ,5
"Let's be kind and call this hotel classic (rather than old-fashioned). Our room was smallish and one step up from basic, but very comfortable, clean and well maintained. Bed could have been bigger (there was space) but I had a good night's sleep. The bathroom could do with being brought into the 21st century; it is not aging so well. The spa was wonderful, and we had a lovely soak. Massage was also excellent. Perfect way to end a wintery afternoon! As always, what makes a difference is the staff, and they were great. Especially Trey and Marco at reception. There was some confusion with our booking (100% my fault) but they figured it out, and followed up with an e-mail later that evening, which was very thoughtful. It was the middle of winter, so the hotel was very quiet, but the…",4
Second time at this hotel spa was real good and out of season hotel real quiet only have one complaint that is found a letter pushed under my door about maid had a smell of smoke in a no smoking hotel and threat of £250 fine. Best thing is I don’t smoke   I wanted go reception and complain but partner wouldn’t let me just saying we just won’t go again ,3
We are regular visitors to this hotel and this visit was far the best. The attention to detail and the comfort of our room was just magic. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the Saffrons restaurant. The spa was very enjoyable. The breakfast was delicious with a great choice on offer.,5
"Amazing overnight stay at Hotel de France! From start to finish! The staff are all really welcoming and friendly, the spa facilities are by far the best on the island, the food was excellent and our room was perfect!",5
"Excellent breakfast, amazing service in restaurant. On arrival our room was changed to one opposite a building site, next to a broom cupboard. The free champagne from our travel agent did not get delivered as the hotel did not tell them our room had been changed. Nor did we get to see the guide arranged by the travel agency at the time as they were sent to the wrong room.  The room was small and nothing special. The outside looked as amazing as it does now in the picture.  I had spent my whole savings to book the 4 days for our honeymoon it's a shame the hotel did not live up to the high standard I had expected of a 4 star hotel.",3
My wife and I spent a superb long weekend relaxing in the hotel and their great spa.   We were welcomed back and looked after with the utmost professionalism. Our request for an easy access room with a walk-in shower was granted by allocating us a very comfortable room in 235. The restaurant staff were extremely helpful with our needs for a gluten free / dairy free option at breakfast and dinner. The meals were excellent. Their great customer care was again tested when I realised that I'd left something in the room but their lost property department stepped up and returned the item to my home address within a couple of days. Great service from all of the staff. Thank you. We plan to return very soon.,5
"I was surprised at how empty the hotel was in the run up to Christmas, however the room was lovely and the staff were so friendly helpful and kind. A beautiful place with a lovely atmosphere. I’d definitely go back. The garden restaurant was a bit lacking in adventurous menu but did the basics. Spa and pool looked amazing wish I’d taken my cosie! ",4
"The hotel was excellent and the staff, especially in garden View restaurant, we very helpful and friendly. Although the bedroom, on 3rd floor, was a single the bed was big and plenty of space in the room. Food in both restaurants was quite expensive. My only real complaint which stops me giving 5* was the hotel was very warm. The pool water was almost as hot as I would have bath water and the fitness was even hotter. Far too hot to exercise in. Why no air conn in there? Also why start breakfast at 7:00 am? Too late for me. I had to pay £5 per day to have it delivered to my room before 6:30! Other than that a very enjoyable 11 day stay.",4
What can I say.... 10 out of 10. Restaurant.... Food was served hot. Brilliant variety. Staff. Very polite attentive especially Jeff. Rooms are very clean and well kept and room service was efficient. Front desk was very accomadating. In fact  felt like royalty Spa pool massage sauna and steam room was a nice treat. .... 1st class service all round..,5
It is a fantastic hotel just a 1km walk from the main town area. Very nice room and hotel as a whole has a very old school look and feel. All in all great place to stay. I didnt stay for breakfast but when I walked past this also looked quite nice.,5
"I chose to stay at this hotel as my cousin lives opposite and it was very convenient! Having looked to stay here in the past I have always opted for a cheaper alternative until now when a ‘Flash Deal’ came up on a search engine!  I had a single room which in some hotels can feel a little cold and like a little less effort has gone into the room than doubles etc... However in this case the room felt special and luxurious and I loved going back to the hotel each evening! The staff at reception and at breakfast were friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were delicious with lots of choice- both from a menu cooked fresh or from a continental buffet of fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, Hams, bread and preserves......perfect!!  I also used the spa which was included in the room rate and I…",5
"First time in jersey and I hope it won't be my last. This hotel is very comfortable and I spent four very happy nights here in October. The exterior reminds me of a French chateau and the interior is very elegant and traditional. I found the staff friendly and pleasant and as I didn't need to complain or make any extra demands, I didn't really have many dealings with anyone. The spa is out of this world and even if it is a little pricey, it is worth it. I recommend the facial! The only down side is that the location of the hotel is slightly outside the town centre. On a fine day and if you're happy walking, it's not impossible but as there were people in my party who were slightly less mobile, we had to take a taxi. There is a shuttle bus but the timings didn't work for our…",4

"stayed here for a business trip as I usually do a couple of times a year, easy checkin and found room ok, a little dated as they are here but clean and tidy.  had a meal in the Garden restaurant and it was ok, not great but not bad... after dinner returned to room and noticed a drone, seemed like a fan going so I turned my bathroom light off but it was still there, later in the evening it went off only to return at 5.30am! waking me up and staying on until I checked out, perhaps another rooms fan.. who knows. avoid room 502 and surrounding rooms if I were you!  health club staff polite, facilities are great which is probably the reason I stay here, but would consider a change due to the dated rooms and noises etc.  just one last thing, a service charge was added to my bill for…",3
"We stayed at Hotel de France for three nights for our Rotary conference. It was, in all respects, excellent. The rooms were large and well furnished. Breakfasts were excellent and the staff could not do enough for us. The spa is amazing. Would thoutoughly recommend this hotel.",5
"I can’t find one even vaguely negative comment to make about this hotel.  I’ve stayed in many lovely grand hotels that have seen better days. Places where the decor may have needed a make-over or the carpets were a bit thread bare or the staffing levels couldn’t be maintained.....  NOT THIS HOTEL. She is still grand still beautiful. A vibrant atmosphere with engaging courteous and thoughtful staff. The decor is spot less and the fabulous lobby area epitomises the quality to be found throughout the building.  Our room with a view was airy, bright and spacious. We were treated with complimentary gifts to celebrate our anniversary.  A wonderful spa and gym facilities add to the appeal and the choices for eating in included one of the top restaurants in town.  I can’t recommend this…",5
"The first thing you see as you drive up the very steep road is a very ugly building stuck right in front of the hotel. Our room was better than we thought it would have been , being very modern.  The bathroom needed a refurb. The hotel throughout is spotlessly clean.  The restaurant where you have breakfast is depressing and dated, orange and blue in colour. The breakfast is poor to say the least. The eggs are just sitting  in a greasy tureen. Poor quality bacon with white stuff all over it. Sausages were pink inside and not very appealing.  The staff in the Orangery need training on how to treat their guests. The fruit, museli and nut's were in very small bowls. Would we stay here again ,NO.",3
Hotel de France is a 15 minute walk into St Helier. There is a steep climb up to front of hotel. As previous reviews state decor is a bit dated but our room was modern.  The pool are and spa are very impressive. ,4
"The title of my posting, is probably a little negative of our overall stay. But here goes as to my reasoning. The staff, service and breakfast for me we're all a five star, and excellent is all areas. Compliments to all in every aspect. I felt as though the rooms, although thoroughly clean were very basic. There were a couple of little touches that could have been easily thought of which are a given in a lot of hotels, as standard, i.e. A bottle of water. The hotels location for us was great, although for those less able, they may have struggled due to the steep drive to get to the hotel. The hotels decor is extremely traditional, and although I am not a posed to a traditional hotel, in some parts there were attempts to be modern, and the two just looked odd. I think they should…",4
The Hotel de France is a traditional hotel offering everything you need for a great stay in Jersey. Situated within walking distance of St Helier town and the harbour it has a great Spa and pool facilities. The breakfast is also excellent with one of the best choices I have seen. The staff are very friendly and helpful as well.,4
"The Hotel De France was the perfect stay for a birthday celebration. The room was clean and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The spa was great for a relaxing swim, steam room or sauna at the end of a busy day exploring the island. But the icing on the cake was the Saffrons restaurant. The service was impeccable and the food absolutely amazing. The 7 course tasting menu was a delight, and we enjoyed it so much we went back the next night to try the a la Carte menu. Also delicious.",5
"This was clearly a very grand old lady of a hotel back in the day, and was part of the reason we booked it. The exterior of the hotel is beautiful (albeit hidden from the roadside) and inside there are still touches of glamour. However in the modern world I think the hotel could do more with the space that they have.  Firstly positives....we tried the afternoon tea and spa, including some treatments - all very lovely indeed, and thoroughly recommended. The spa is very spacious and well appointed and the staff were great. We also ate in the hotel on more than one occasion in the Garden View restaurant - the food was lovely. Breakfast was also very good - with a large selection of options. All of the staff we encountered were brilliant - extremely helpful and friendly. There is a…",4
"I stayed at Hotel de France when staying for a few days on business.  The hotel is a little walk out of town and hidden behind a more modern building so not really viewable from the road.   The hotel is a very traditional hotel. A little old fashioned but nice and clean and in a good condition. I had a room on the 5th floor, the top floor. The room was small, but lovely. Beautiful views and it had everything I needed. I noticed on other floors they had higher ceilings that gave the idea of more space.   On the first night we decided to take a quick dip in the pool. Well, this was the treat of the trip. What a beautiful space and lovely pool. It's just a shame we didn't get to spend as more time there.  We also had dinner in the Garden restaurant one night, reviewed separately.  …",4
"My first visit to Jersey and a great hotel to choose as a base. The rooms were beautifully clean, the Garden View restaurant was a good choice for dinner on both evenings and the Lounge Bar was comfortable and served a good selection of drinks and cocktails. All the staff were friendly and attentive. We were able to use the spa today after checking out this morning. The spa is a lovely place to relax and unwind. The pools are great and there are a wide variety of treatments available. The only negative was the spa staff’s reluctance to supply us with robes...despite the fact that the Reception staff had told us they would be provided. After a trip to Reception in my wet towel, robes were forthcoming. Such a shame to end our trip on a negative note when everything else had been…",4
"We stayed here for a weekend.  Arrived late to be met with a room in a time warp. Burgundy was the theme with hospital blankets in the bed Yuk! To boot we had hairs in the very off white bath.  We were delayed, the room was cold but we complained the next day - we were moved, to another wing the decor was much improved (like the photos) but it was tiny.  There was an inter locking door so the room was probably got kids ! The pool / spa was stunning, the food great and the location was fine .....why still offer really outdated rooms and expect guests to pay £150 per night for a sub standard rating :( we were offered £50 off as I said the room didn’t correspond with the pictures ! ) not really good enough though for a hotel that sells itself differently and offers 4 star 🌟 ",2
"Excellent staff, lovely hotel - very clean and comfortable, especially the beds and bed linen. We booked for the spa facilities which were gorgeous (pool was a bit cold) had treatments in the spa which were so relaxing. Outdoor area lovely.

This was a surprise birthday gift for my wife for the weekend. Hotel was very Grand and easy for booking in but there was nobody there to take your bags perhaps we were there at a busy time; the room was very nice very clean and had great views.  Restaurant wise I thought was limited and Expensive they could have more variation we ate out both nights but I can't fault the Breakfast Excellent. This hotel has great facilities but needs to cater more in the food department at more affordable prices.,3
Nice hotel with good breakfast and helpful shuttle bus to town.  Very friendly and helpful staff. My only complaint was that we could hear everything in the next door adjoining room and the bath/shower had an old fashioned shower curtain that made showers a little uncomfortable. Maybe time for an upgrade.,4
"Have not visited Jersey for years but decided to go for a week to the Hotel de France. It was an excellent choice. The staff were fantastic. Friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We had drinks and food in the Garden Restaurant both inside and on the patio. Food really good and we must commend the waiter in charge of outside patio. Could not have been better. The bedroom were spotless, the bed comfortable and so quiet at night the sleep quality was great.  We went for breakfast and the room had always been serviced by the time we returned. First class. There was an excellent and very convenient covered garage for our hire car free of charge to guests. One little disappointment. We did not think the cooked breakfast was great. Some items were overcooked such as…",5
"The location is uninspiring but an easy 10-15 minute walk to town.  Alternatively it is easily reached by bus, taxi or the free hotel shuttle.  It has an elevated position so there is a short ascent from the road to the entrance.  Our standard room appeared to have been recently refurbished and was clean, comfortable and reasonably spacious.  A mini-fridge would be a welcome addition.  The wi-if was consistently good.  There is a high-end expensive restaurant for fine dining and a bistro serving good, straight forward food at reasonable prices but with limited menu choice.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is far more relaxed than might be expected from the imposing frontage.  It was much more competitively priced than most of the other hotels we considered…",5
"My partner and I booked a 3 night break here for my birthday.   The hotel is within walking distance of St Helier (15 minutes on flat roads) although there is a steep slope or steps to enter the hotel itself. They do offer a daily shuttle service. We caught the no. 15 bus from the airport and walked. I’m glad the hotel was not in the town centre as I don’t feel it would’ve been as quiet.   The hotel is very grand looking from the exterior, although it is quite dated on the inside.    Even though our room was at the rear of the hotel overlooking what I assumed to be the roof of the kitchen and a large water tank, this didn’t bother us as it was very quiet. The room was dated much like the remainder of the hotel but it was exceptionally clean and was serviced everyday.   Breakfast…",5
"We stayed in the Hotel de France in early September.  It’s a large independent hotel in St Helier, around 20 minutes walk from the town centre.  We walked each time to and from the town, but if walking is an issue then a bus or taxi may be required.  The hotel itself is very nice with an older worldey feel about it.  Very helpful attentive staff.  Our room was on the 5th floor with nice views over St Helier.  The room was nicely appointed, with everything you would need.  The breakfast was served in the Orangery, and had a wide selection of British and Continental choices.  I would definitely consider staying here again, if we are back in St Helier.",5
This hotel is a little gem! We paid a mid range price for what we thought would be a mid range hotel but it far exceeded our expectations. The hotel was clean and well presented. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was bigger than we expected and had a jumbo sized double bed. Breakfast was served in the orangery which was picturesque and the self service food was plentiful and varied. We ate our evening meals in the Garden View restaurant. The weather was nice so we ate outside on the terrace each night with a beautiful view of the garden (there's a surprise). There was a good choice of food available ranging from a bar type meals to something a bit special - all at reasonable prices. The restaurant staff were attentive and helpful. The highlight of the…,5

"Hidden behind the unattractive medical centre is this beautiful looking hotel. The room had an enormous comfy bed, a nice clean bathroom but not enough electric sockets. We had to buy bottled water because the water from the bathroom tap tasted unpleasant. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly but the restaurant and breakfast staff were unwelcoming and had an unattractive superior attitude. Few vegetarian options in the restaurant but otherwise very nice food. The spa treatments were fabulous. Jersey is beautiful and we will definitely return, however not to this hotel as we were not made to feel truly welcome.",3
"Nice hotel bit dated nice rooms if you have a view. Spa rooms are good as have air con and are big with decent views. Spa looks amazing really nice but every area was cold no warm areas , no hot tub area nothing this is very odd and very disappointing. We had issues with our room do not let them allocate you 306 or 309 we sorted it in the end but had to pay to upgrade. It’s about a 15 min walk into St Helier or a £7 taxi hotel does run a one way shuttle but didn’t use but good idea. Grounds are kept nice. Breakfast was ok good pastries but very greasy cooked breakfast the room is very dated and not very nice but that’s my opinion . I wouldn’t stay here again due to the mess up with rooms and how it was handled and due to the location.",3
"I was here for a 24 hr flying business trip. Check in was slick and professional. My room was beautiful, not large but certainly big enough to be comfortable.the view over the terrace and beyond was lovely. The day I arrived the weather was scorching so we sat on the terrace for our initial business meeting which was very sociable. Although we only had breakfast in the hotel which was fine, they have a high end Indian restaurant in the hotel which looked good. Service for drinks was ...relaxed....everything came .... eventually.....over all it’s a place I would like go back to and explore more. Down side was the terrace bar closed at 10 pm but I guess it was a Sunday and there was an alternative in the hotel. ",4
Great hotel everything you would want lovey food great facilities comfortable room staff attentive very clean gardens are beautiful with mass of colour car parking which is so handy all round an excellent hotel,5
"This Hotel has been there for a long time. Been renovated a while ago, makes it pleasant to stay. Nice swimming pool and spa area. We had meals and drinks in the Garden View Restaurant. Very good and friendly staff. The breakfast was plentiful and a large choice. Walking distance from the hotel to St Helier about 15 to 20 min. The hotel also has a shuttle bus 4 times a day. Taxi from town, £ 7, to Airport £ 17. When we were there it was very warm/hot, so was our room on the fifth floor. That was the only drawback.",4
"From the history of the hotel one would expect dark, dismal old fashioned rooms instead, step into a 21st century relaxing room; furnished with two arm chairs so that both of you can sit comfortably.   You start the day with a breakfast suitable for most dietary needs in the Orangery before setting out for a day, with transport down to the town on a courtesy bus.   Why not try the spa and indulge in snacks or meals in one of two restaurants in the hotel if you do not wish to go exploring.[ A good place for those who wish to chill out and relax",5
"had a lovely balcony room with stunning scenery overlooking town and could even see the sea., beautiful bathroom and hotel brilliant as before.  staff couldn't have been more helpful,. breakfast lovely and a very lovely stay will go again",5
"I have been coming for years to this hotel & it has changed over the years & building work in the old wing will start at the end of year turning them into flats. I had a package with BA 22nd-27th July 2018 (see separate review with BA). I got a lovely warm welcome back from staff who know me, warm welcome to Hotel de France from new staff. I was checked in by Mario by this time I was over 3.5hrs late due to my flight delayed flight etc please read my flight review. They were expecting bout 1pmish. I gave my cc, so I could charge anything to my room, my room was ready. Check in 2pm, check out 11am, could be poss for charge stay later re flight or ferry going later only if available no harm in asking. I got my old room back 401 did ask for an upgrade, but hotel full. this a single…",5
"We stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of August. Weather wise it was a tale of 2 halves...bright hot beginning for a few days followed by thunderstorms & heavy rain. We didn't mind either as staying at the hotel de France was delightful. We loved it. The service is perfect. On check in we were greeted by a professional, fun and informative receptionist ....Marco...what an asset to this hotel. Saying that every member of staff we came into contact was fantastic. We were celebrating our 30th anniversary & we were made to feel very special. We enjoyed the wide choice of buffet breakfast, found the hotel comfortable & clean & loved relaxing  in the spa pools but it's the customer service that we will remember above all. Thank you",5
"Stayed here for 3 nights (August 2018) with my mum for a short break. We were both really pleased with the hotel. The room was lovely. Recently renovated, huge bathroom, comfortable beds. The staff were really helpful and friendly. Every one of them would smile and say hello or good morning whenever you came into contact with them. The breakfast was plentiful. A good variety from cereal, danish pastries, full english, juice, yoghurt, cheese, ham etc etc. The plates for the hot food were nice and hot themselves. Couldn't fault it. The gardens were gorgeous, not a lot of sunbeds in the gardens but i managed to get one after being out all day, about 4pm, where I read a book and enjoyed a glass of rose. Both my mum and I really enjoyed it here. ",5
Loved the week here in Jersey at this stunning hotel . Beautiful grounds and spa areas. Rooms were lovely tho very hot ..fan was provided as there was no air conditioning in bedroom .Main hotel was lovely and cool . Shuttle service to town was good tho could provide an evening option or airport pick up . Food was lovely in Garden View Terrace and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this hotel and would hope to return sometime . Staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the local area . ,5
"I took my 13 year old daughter for a weeks stay. Our room was like any hotel around the country, good size, comfortable beds, excellent housekeeping. We basically did not leave the garden sunloungers from sun up to down. Beautiful setting. Nipped in and out of the pools to cool down. Hotel isn't as dated as people say. Everything is spotlessly clean. Breakfast was amazing, no end of choice. Used the laundry service, very reasonable. My only gripe, and one to watch is the service charge on every drink. Paying £4 a pint of cider and them adding 90p to hand it over the bar is unacceptable. And being charged for tap water!! I brought this up at reception and they agreed they get numerous complaints about it. They took it off the bill without a fuss, but beggars the question,why do…",5
"Stunning hotel with fantastic spa facilities. Beautiful gardens & terrace, with barbecue in the evening. The singer was excellent on Saturday night, great entertainment.  Staff was all welcoming. Will definitely be back.",5
"Rooms are fine well equipped & Clean. Great views from most of the rooms overlooking St Helier. Garden View restaurant which is hotel restaurant open every day. Watch out the prices are steep ! They will catch you out with special of the day being most expensive & add service charges. It’s fast service, Can’t wait to get you sorted & out for next. Good if your in rush. Food is ok.  Photo is view from room.",3
This was our second trip to Jersey and staying at Hotel de France.   A beautiful hotel with good food and pleasant staff.  We had booked a twin room but on arrival we actually had a suite with a dressing room and double sink bathroom.   It was very warm when we were there and as well as air conditioning there was a free standing fan in the room which made it very pleasant especially at night.   The huge terrace and gardens are excellent.  Although the hotel was fully booked there was plenty of areas for lounging about with it being crowded and sitting under the umbrella with lovely calming music it was fantastic.   I would recommend this hotel to any visiting Jersey for the first time as you will definitely go back time and time again,5
"First class hotel, good location, lovely building will great gardens, mini bus service to town centre, breakfast excellent with plenty of choice, lack of air conditioning in bedrooms a minus in very hot weather, staff efficient and helpful",5
Really enjoyed my stay - the room was on the small size but clean and good amenities. Close to the centre of st.helier with a lovely spa - great for winter or summer! The food is good value and high quality - highly recommend,5
"My friends offered my husband and I a guest pass to try out the spa facilities with a view to become members. The spa itself is beautiful, clean and extremely relaxing BUT the managaress and the spa staff are rude, unapproachable, and their customer service is extremely poor. We were exactly two minutes late (due to dining in the restaurant just next door) to the changing room and were repeatedly told to hurry. We found that our personal belongings had been moved from the changing rooms to the reception and we were refused a shower. When we explained our situation we were smirked at and told again that they had staff who needed to come in to clean. There was no cleaning staff around at this point. The customer is ALWAYS right and should be treated with respect. My friend and I…",1
"What a fantastic hotel, so friendly, nothing is too much trouble. Very homely, family run hotel. Most of The staff have worked there for over 20 yrs, that says it all! The room we had was on the back of the hotel with no view, but for what we paid we didn’t expect anything else. The room was plenty big enough & very comfortable beds. The bathroom was a good size with plenty of toiletries & all kept very clean. The room was quite considering we were only one room between the lift and us!  Well what can I say other than it’s the best most modern spa I have ever been to. We would return to this hotel just to use the spa!! Wish I lived on Jersey so I could join! We ate at the garden restaurant 4 out of the 5 night stay, I would highly recommend it if you want informal dining, every…",5
"I’ve just returned from a 5 night stay at the Hotel de France- it is a lovely hotel- my room was great (overlooking the gardens so if you’re sensitive to noise from people chatting out in the terrace restaurant ask for a room either higher up or on the other side- it didn’t bother me at all but everyone’s different). The room was clean and had plenty of space- nice bathroom- large towels and nice toiletries. The hotel itself was very peaceful- even though it seemed quite full, it wasn’t noisy or raucous (this is not a party hotel so if that’s your thing, you’ll probably be bored here!) Breakfast had a great selection and service was quick (eg for tea/coffee for the table). I ate most nights in the garden view restaurant and it was good food (I’m veggie, so it was nice to be able…",5
"Lovely relaxing hotel, excellent staff. Brilliant selection at breakfast, used the hotel restaurant every night as food was great, could sit outside in the beautiful weather with a great view. We had no view out of our bedroom but we were only in there to sleep so that wasn’t a problem! We had hot weather and the room stayed cool as this was one of our concerns. Exceptional cleanliness and the spa was one of the best we’ve ever been to around the world. Would definitely return, even to stay a week in the hotel and not go out. The shuttle service to the town was a great added bonus.",5
"Had 3 nights at the Hotel De France to celebrate our 40th Wedding anniversary . We stayed there in 1978 and this was our first trip back there .   As you can imagine , things have changed (!) but I have to say for the better .   The Spa is superb - great facilities and a warm welcome .  Overall the stay was pretty fantastic - little things like staff who take the trouble to ask you how things are and one particular young man ( Remy) who went to a huge amount of trouble to find us some pictures from our last stay and even copied them for us , makes all the difference .   Our room was great - huge , with a lovely view over St Helier and wonderful bathroom. Breakfast was good - huge selection of things to choose from   The hotel is pretty well placed outside of the busy St Helier…",5
"Really nice facilities in the spa and outdoor area, but there is some staff that ruined our stay. The people that work at the gym have been rude and dismissive every time we go and say a million different things to us each time we ask something which is just confusing. In the spa the staff also make you feel quite uncomfortable by staring through the glass window at all times. Need to work on their customer service...",2
"Luxury hotel which did not disappoint. Single room was clean and comfortable, just lacking a decent view, however this did not spoil time spent there. The hotel staff were all welcoming and helpful, very efficient in manner, making my stay hassle free!  Please check out the wellness spa and the garden view eaterie, which both offered perfect host to a female solo traveller looking for R and R.",4
"Myself and my sister stayed last October for 3 nights.  We enjoyed it so much that we have booked our parents a 4 night break for their 50 Wedding Anniversary.  They are so excited as they also have not visited Jersey before.  The room, staff, food, spa were excellent.  Dion on reception was particularly helpful, professional and curteous and so we have had all dealings for our parents break with her personally.  These days it can be challenging to find staff members with a ""can do"" and professional attitude but Dion surpassed our expectations and has gone above and beyond.  The Jersey Island Bus Tour is a must if you've not been before to get your bearings - very informative.",5
"The facilities are so nice, clean and well looked after. It is very nice and feels like you are on holiday. However, the rule that you have to be over 16 to go the gym is ridiculous! You should be allowed to go in if accompanied by an adult. The staff are all nice except for this one lady working on the desk going to the gym who was very rude, dismissive and just generally judgey which made my visit not as enjoyable as it could be. Really need to work on the customer service...",3
Staff were all great Restaurant Menu never changed except for the specials No facilities for young people.Especially for exercise Our room was awful.Like a sweat box. No air conditioning Quite a walk to the town centre.It cost us £7 in a metered taxi from the town centre to the hotel which demonstrates the distance. Stayed with my wife and son,3
"Stay in this hotel regularly with work and the garden restaurant let’s the whole stay down I will not eat in there again. Although room service is a £5 tray charge! Upon entering the restaurant you will have checked the menu outside, don’t it’s different from what is available, don’t be tempted by the mussels gets you into the restaurant but never available. Last stay and this stay there is a chef cooking bbq outside on both occasions this was not offered, explained or advertised is this vip only? Service is poor, staff need name badges, most are new and mean well but you arrive and stand waiting to be seated while a waiter will continue clearing a table with no acknowledgment (obviously not allowed to seat guests- so go get someone?!) so stand there for five minutes feeling…",3
"A litttle bit out of the way up the hill. But peaceful for it. And a free shuttle is available.   She’s showing her age. Especially in the Orangerie breakfast room: that’s a strange old place. But the food in it is great - super selection for breakfast.   Attic room 512 was lovely. Corner position high above the town. No aircon there, be warned!    So blast with the fans to stay cool.  Worth it for the room though. Other rooms were smaller and less characterful.   Staff are really helpful. Every single interaction was a pleasure. They couldn’t do enough for us. Delightful.   Terrace for dinner is really nice. And the food is not overpriced.   Never got to the spa... too lovely outside!  ",4
Stayed here for 2 nights in an executive room.  Hotel is nice but showing it's age.  Room was large but again in need of some tlc.   The breakfast buffet was quite extensive but some of the hot food was quite cool.   We had a snack in the garden restaurant but it also wasn't that great.,3
"The Good Lady and I stayed here for a long weekend. The staff are great, very helpful and courteous. We loved the chilled out sun loungers on the lawn with gentle music playing and spent the ends of our afternoons flitting between the pool and lawns. The brassiere terrace is good with great quality food. The gym is also of a very high standard. Only downside was the room (272)we actually found it a bit depressing, the lighting was poor and it all seemed a worn. The view wasn’t great either looking across metal clad roofs. Bathroom was good clean and functional.",4
"Been to Jersey several times, but this was the 1st time we stayed at the Hotel de France. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed by warm, funny and helpful reception staff. Rooms were good in size, nicely decorated and a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was excellent and could not ask for better. Amazing pool, spa and gym area and lovely sun terrace. The hotel was easy walk to the centre of St Helier too. We visited with another couple who equally loved the hotel. Definitely return on our next visit to Jersey.",4
"I loved the wonderful Jacuzzi pool, with the water jets pouring out. The staff is friendly and helpful, attentive to your every need.  Paolo and Ben at the restaurant were fun to speak to, Julie at the front desk was patient and kind,  and changed my room for me, as it was very hot.  Remy, Nicolai, Abby, Anthese, and Florence were all very kind.  One thing I found difficult was navigating all the space, as the hotel is huge and I am somewhat handicapped after a car accident.  Also,  there is no bathroom at the casual restaurant and you must take a lift or the stairs.  I used the one in the spa area, which is in the same floor.",4
For my birthday my lovely wife Pam booked us into the  Hotel de France on Jersey it was a spectacular hotel overlooking St. Helier. The food and service were excellent and good portion sizes with plenty of choices. We stayed on the third floor in a massive comfortable room. The hotel has a choice of 3 restaurants and bars because of our limited time we used the veranda restaurant it was excellent and the staff were very friendly. We would reommend this hotel. ,4
"The hotel looms over the edge of the capital, aspiring to chateau style magnificence. St Helier is probably the least attractive area of the island. The buildings around are a mish-mash of styles, relatively modern and uninspiring. Suffice it to say that when I looked up architecture in St Helier, the first article that came up was a debate on which was the ugliest building in the town. Further into the centre, via a warren of small streets, there are a few more French curlicues, lots of shops (some in a converted warehouse) and a couple of colourful flag bedecked bustling markets. One has a fountain with some odd plastic mannequins sitting on spouts and the other is crammed with local fish and orange-red seafood. There are various statues – a gilded George II (he gave the…",4
"Nice hotel although a bit tired in places. The room is pleasantly large, also the bathroom with deep bath and walk in shower. Plenty of lovely toiletries. Breakfast buffet is rather corporate, just the usual things, croissants, toast, Danishes etc. Selection of cereals, fruit and yoghurts. Cooked breakfast, the same each day. Omelettes are extra ££'s. A chef cooking these on the spot would be nice. The walk up to the hotel is very steep, so not suitable for wheelchairs, buggys etc. A courtesy bus will take you into St Helier although the walk is easy and takes only 15 minutes maximum. If you take the 10am bus you can wait at the same spot for the midday bus and he will take you back. Taxis are £6 from town to hotel. Worth it just to save the walk up the steep drive! Food in…",4
"I’m afraid this hotel doesn’t get a tripadvisor 5 only because of the swelteringly warm bedroom. We upgraded both our rooms to executive rooms as on the hotels website it listed these room types as having air conditioning. We now know after our stay that this was an error in the description by the hotel and they have resolved the situation. However, the room was still swelteringly warm throughout our stay, we honestly couldn’t wait to leave the bedroom. The bedroom was a large size for Jersey, not too modern but quite acceptable, of course apart from the awful very warm room temperature which couldn’t be lowered despite using the useless floor fan the hotel provide & opening both windows. Truly awful. We loved the swimming pool. It is brand new or looks like it’s brand new, very…",4
Great hotel. Excellent reception staff which is unusual. However let down in some areas so can't give five stars. Breakfast on Saturday we had to weight five minutes to be seated because there were no clean tables that we could sit at which was strange because there was a whole balcony area set up for breakfast but apparently guests weren't allowed to use in case they made it messy.  Every day there was a different draught beer that was unavailable.  Admittedly we were prewarned at checking that there would be noise from a function on Saturday. Could not believe it till we got back to the hotel on Saturday evening to hear Rick Ashley belting throught the speakers up two floors and quite clearly audible in our bedroom which was two floors above the disco. ,5
"Another great stay at this beautiful hotel. Warm friendly welcome as we checked in and lovely friendly staff, nothing too much trouble. Visited last year with hubby but this time was with my mother in law , we stayed in a spa room which was lovely and great sitting out on balcony and admiring view over st hellier. Room large airy and spotless with queen sized bed small couch chair and coffee table , bathroom very spacious with large bath separate shower and lovely spa toiletries. Spa is beautiful and again staff welcoming and helpful and a great place to relax and enjoy the amenities. Breakfast plentiful and great choice and very enjoyable. Both restaurants at hotel are well worth a visit. This is a very grand old hotel with a great history and well worth a visit. Shuttle bus…",5
"Saffrons restaurant food at the hotel is incredible. Was taken there for my birthday and I was blown away! I am a bit of a foodie so it is not always easy to wow me but the tasting menu was just delicious, flavoursome and beautifully presented. The place would do with a little modernisation perhaps but the views were fab and service excellent. The cocktails were amazing and fresh too.",4
"What a fantastic hotel, one of the best I’ve ever stayed in.  I travelled to Jersey alone and I arrived early. They allowed me to check in no problem.  Every member of staff was friendly and helpful, from the reception staff to the bar staff and cleaners. All made me feel very at ease and welcomed.  My room was cosy and clean. Good supply of tea and coffee and also toiletries which were replenished each day.  The pool area was spotless, lots of places to sit and read my book and not too many people in there which was good! You can go to the pool through the hotel in your robe which saves messing about in the changing room and you can take a fresh towel in the spa area.  It’s out of town slightly but it only took me 15 minutes to walk to the harbour, maybe a bit longer if you…",5
"3 night stay was fantastic, the staff were very friendly and helpful, room was brilliant (we had the spa room with balcony) and the pool and spa area is lovely and relaxing.  The pool area is quite big so even with a few people it still seems spacious.  There is a free bus once an hour (except Sunday) to town and back or there is a paid bus (as the hotel for timetable) which picks up and returns at the end of the hotel driveway (£2 per person each way)   The walk into town is about 20 minutes stroll.  ",5
"Hotel and services excellent..Reception staff exceptional...Spa superb...Breakfast disapointing due to luke warm food (as usual with these sort of Buffets) and some items not replenished. We had a Spa room on the first floor which was spacious,clean and well appointed.However,we were disapointed in the limited view of St.Helier as the balcony was on the same level as a roof on a very close modern outbuiding.",4
"Visited with a friend and my Mum.  Good points, myself and my friend shared a Spa room  ( they don't do single beds in these which is a bit odd) anyway, lovely room and views are amazing over St Helier.  Breakfast has a very good range and choices. Food is ok, had a Lasagna which wasn't a lasagna, I complained and got a free dessert and it was taken off the menu for the next eve. The staff are very friendly and helpful, there is a shuttle bus into town, however buses run passed the hotel anyway, bonus is the Zoo is on the bus route. The Indian is extremely pricey so we did not eat in there.  The Spa is really nice and relaxing so recommended, treatments are pricey. My Mum's room was small and for the price she paid for a week was a little disappointing.  The hotel could do with…",4
We stayed over Easter weekend in a spa room on the 4th floor which had the added bonus of a balcony that looked out across St Helier towards the coast.  The room was very spacious with everything you could need and daily housekeeping.  It was clean and nicely decorated and in very good condition.    Reception were excellent and arranged car hire with a local firm who brought the car to the hotel and arranged for us to drop it off at the airport.  There was lots of information about local attractions available.  Breakfast was continental style and we also ate at Garden View which had a lovely choice on the menu and daily specials too.  The staff were excellent and even went to the trouble of getting fever tree tonic from the main bar for us.  All our meals were of a high…,5
"Lovely hotel, lots of character. The staff on reception were excellent. Quick check in and very helpful. Our room and bathroom were very clean, but our room on the 4th floor was very hot. It just had a fan, no air conditioning. Breakfasts were very good with plenty of choice. We felt the menu in the garden room restaurant was rather limited. Not a lot of choice.  There is a courtesy bus into town which we only used once, because we enjoyed the walk there and back. For anyone with mobility problems it is quite a hike.",4
My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary for the third year in a row. It’s always such a treat to come here and feel like you’re on a holiday. The hotel is a classic and retains a personal feel about it with many long serving staff. Ayush spa is probably the best in the Island and Saffrons (separate review) the best restaurant. ,5
"I stayed the middle of May at the above Hotel.   The reception staff were absolutely  fantastic, nothing was too much trouble.   I enjoyed the spa, swimming pool etc.   However when visiting the Garden View Restaurant.  My visits were not very pleasant.   The staff here were too busy cleaning tables and tidying up.  You had to constantly put your hand up to get their attention.   My sister and I ordered a bowl of soup for our starters which took 15 mins to arrive.  Our main course took 20 mins.   This happended during a quiet period.   The staff do not come back to your table to ask ""is everything ok"".  I did complain and was given two glasses of wine.  It was the principle of the matter.  We visted after this and the staff were a bit more attention but it didnt last long.  So…",4
"Having decided to treat ourselves to some luxury we have stayed at a “six star hotel near Watford” and here at the Hotel de France.  The Hotel de France is by far the better, the room nicer and the Spa much nicer.  Add to that friendlier staff and we had an enjoyable stay",5
"Stayed here for one night on business. The hotel looks very grand from the outside and the gym and spa all looked very nice but the rooms were dated and it was a maze to get to my room. Up in the lift, up and down a couple of flights of stairs, round the corner and through the door lugging bags wasn't fun. The walls are also very thin, I could here the person next door on the toilet and could also here them snoring. Breakfast was very nice though. ",3
"The hotel is a little dated still stuck in the 80's, but there are many positive about this hotel, it has a great Spa and wellness centre  The Saffron restaurant is one of the best in Jersey ( need to book ) The exterior terrace area is a real sun trap and with excellent food being served from the terrace bar ... its all you need to relax with your G&T The negatives are 1. The reception staff are not helpful always 2. The spa rooms (suites) all look on the spa wall and roof, get the high floor if you want to enjoy the city view 3. The breakfast restaurant and food are not the best.  4. The hotel has given all the attractive rooms with garden rooms to the business rooms, which is obviously the Hotel priority  5. The reception is on the lower floor and there are no toilets on this…",4
Just come back from a fantastic break heavenly spa wonderful food in the garden View restaurant special mention to Tracey and her fantastic staff for looking after us so we’ll when I had a medical emergency everyone was so helpful can’t wait to return,5
"We stayed for four nights over the early May Bank Holiday weekend. The hotel was excellent as usual and the welcome from all staff from front desk onwards was all that you could wish for in a hotel. We look forward to visiting again in 2019, if not before.",5
We had a great weekend. Well looked after from arriving at the hotel - when we realised we’d booked 2 rooms rather than 1! No problem though.  Room was lovely with great views.  Saffrons restaurant has the most amazing Asian European fusion food. Our 2 hour treatment in the spa topped off our stay. Great location - short walk into the centre of St Helier.  Would def go back for a 3rd time..,4
"I had booked a single room and got upgraded to a twin.  Nice bright attic room, very warm at night but thankfully there was a fan in the room which was essential.  Only one lift was working during my stay, which, being on the 5th floor, caused some delays.  No explanation given as to why the other lift was out of order.  I found the staff very helpful and friendly, and enjoyed the food in the garden view restaurant.  I loved the swimming pool and also used the gym facilities a couple of times.",4
"Hi came back to Jersey to move my daughter back to London. Had a big van so was nice to have plenty of room to park. Love this hotel great health club,nice breakfast and always a good place to stay.Thoughly recommend this hotel.",4
Hotel and facilities were excellent. Some delays were experienced in obtaining food from the café. It was a good 15 minute walk to the centre of St. Helier. Otherwise an excellent experience which we would be happy to repeat. ,5
"Large, grand looking hotel about 15/20 minutes walk to the town (a courtesy bus is available at set times). Nice welcome at reception and room size was fine. Good breakfast with lots of choice and fresh fruits. Spa and swimming pool facilities were also very good. Free parking as well. Couple of negatives that prevented a final star..the weather was very hot during our stay (not a complaint!) but our room had no air conditioning. We had a fan sent up but the room was still roasting. Windows had to be left open all night causing some noise issues. Finally we had an issue with staff bringing wrong mixers for drinks - requested slimline tonic and three times they came with ordinary. Then bar upstairs only had fever tree tonic although bar staff brought a bottle of slimline up.…",4
"We stayed at this hotel over the Easter break and although the weather was not good, we could not fault the hotel, food, rooms or swimming facilities.  We did not use the spa. Flew BA excellent and good few family days.",5
Visited for a short break and chose this hotel for the spa.  Hotel and staff and food very nice indeed but was let down by the spa. Spa pool was not warm enough to relax in shame as facilities were good. Treatments vastly overpriced and very inadequate.,4
"We  were able to take a few days, so Jersey seemed a good place to go . Went by Condor Ferries. both boat trips were on time in fact , on arrival into Jersey we then went by car to Hotel de France. Found the Hotel very nice ,staff welcoming ,Breakfast was great. the only down side was one of the lifts was out of action for some 36 hours + putting pressure on the remaining lift.Over all very pleased with the break.",5
Stayed here with friends a great hotel as a base to explore whole island a warm feeling coming back to this daily. Comfortable rooms food and restaurant very good with attentive staff. Spa superb to relax after a busy day walking. Would use again on any future visit to Jersey,5
"We were part of a party of 14 - celebrating our friend's 60th Birthdays - from the moment we arrived (and were able to check in early - thank you!) the staff were friendly, helpful and patient. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the Garden restaurant on the Friday night and drinks in the bar on the Saturday night before going out for a meal.  Rooms were lovely and breakfast great - lots of choice and plenty of it.  Only briefly managed to use the spa facilities - beautiful pools and lovely steam room.  Would love to go back again.  Thank you!",5
"When I stayed in the Hotel de France in 2015, I ate at the Garden View restaurant. While the food was lovely, the staff were distracted and it was very difficult to grab their attention. I was left sitting there for long periods and the frustration really impaired the experience.  Fast forward three years - it is lashing rain and I am nearby. I decide to try again. Once again, the food choice and quality were excellent. Competitively priced and beautifully presented.  And the staff? Excellent. I was greeted with a warm welcome, seated quickly and they were attentive throughout. When I said I didn't want dessert or coffee, I was left in peace to finish my drink and read.   It was so pleasant. I look forward to visiting again.  Any negatives? One. The menus were on the grubby and…",4
"Jersey has only a few top hotels and this seems to be one of them. Although certainly not the most glamorous, it has its charm. It has a rather lovely white stone facade and in the large reception area is a spiral staircase. Check in was quick and easy and the staff were extremely helpful.  The hotel from the outside looks great and has a lovely garden with terrace and patio area. The restaurant/bar area serves a range of bar type food and variety of snacks, as well as your typical wine and cocktail assortment.   The rooms are plain and in need of a revamp, but they are clean and spacious and have everything required for a stay away. I was here for business and it had everything I needed, including a decent WiFi and power sockets.  The main restaurant is large and serves…",3
"Lovely hotel, probably, the best we have stayed in at this price.  The rooms were fitted out to a very high standard.  The pool and spa area looked inviting but we did not have time to use them.  I enjoyed the Jacuzzi bath instead.  The quality bath robes were appreciated.",5
Very well run hotel. Good attention to detail.  Restaurants are good. Position of hotel excellent. Great hotel for any occasion. Clean well laid out gardens and service is excellent. Would recommend this hotel to families or friends ,5
"Great place to stay, staff service very good, as are the amenities, you will not be disappointed, good food and a choice of restaurants, bedrooms were clean,tidy and not tired, we will be going back there soon.",5
This Hotel offers the highest levels in both accommodation and service. The refurbished rooms are wonderful! Spa is a joy and the breakfasts offer both outstanding quality and choice. Staff are polite and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. ,5
I'm a regular visitor at the Hotel de France and would certainly recommend it to anyone considering a holiday in Jersey. Recommend you make the most of your visit and try a meal at Saffrons and a treatment at the Ayush Spa. They're both amazing experiences.,5
Excellence abounds. We could not have been better looked after.  The staff were superb.  The sun shone; the weather was warm / hot!  Cannot think of anything to have improved the experience.  This will be our first choice for Jersey the next time we visit.,5
"A good hotel that would be excellent if it sorts out the service in the Garden Room Restaurant, and has an option for a softer mattress. The staff are unfailingly helpful, and friendly.  Car parking is good, but the spaces are slightly narrow.",4
"This is a very attractive hotel and the room we had was in the new part of the hotel. The room was very large with space for a sofa and chair. The bathroom was incredibly spacious with a nice walk in shower and a large bath. We used the lounge bar and the restaurant both of which had good service, drinks and food. Breakfast was a buffet with a large selection of hot and cold food. The hot food was a bit dried up at times from being under the heat lamps too long.",5
"Lovely hotel with superb staff and facilities.  the food was excellent and the location was only 10 minutes walk into St Helier.  The view from the back of the hotel isn't great and in our room the walls were a little thin, we could hear the guests next door talking quite clearly.  I'd definitely stay again and probably will later this year.",4
"I stay at this hotel 2 or 3 times a year for business and its great, the staff are very friendly, rooms are ALWAYS spotless, the food is excellent. NOT the cheapest on the island but you get what you pay for and I will carry on using the Hotel De Framce.",5
"This beautiful hotel has a very nice sun terrace, perfect anytime of the day as it is south facing. Outdoor tables, chairs and sofas under sun canopy’s surrounded by tropical plants. Great for coffee, lunch or dinner. The pool and spa open up onto the lawned area, where sun loungers are placed around the gardens for your comfort. We stayed in the new part, up on the 5th floor. The room was large, very clean and fresh. It was quite warm, but then it was 27 degrees outside. The staff were very helpful and attentive, with an air of old fashioned values. They made everyone feel special. The pool, spa and gym areas are amazing, free to guests and well worth a visit. The pool opens really early so we went down just before breakfast, peaceful and relaxing. Very nice breakfast with a…",5
"Stayed here 33 years ago on our Honeymoon and personally I think it has changed for the worst. It was a nice French style Chateaux and made you feel welcome, now you are just a room number. They have extended to one side with brand new rooms so big you could get 2 double beds in therel only one lift to our room and you have to walk along one long corridor to the new part take the lift and another walk to your room. It is expensive which i new it would be and I asked for a room with a balcony and garden views. Got the balcony no garden veiws and would you believe this cost me an extra £500. Have a bath but know handles anywhere to help you get in and out. I have arthritis in both knees.",3
We had a standard room whilst family members had a larger room in new part of hotel. Our room was perfectly reasonable if a little bit old and small but other room in new part was lovely. Very large and well layed out. Rest of hotel very nice and clean and pool area is really nice. ,5
A very nice hotel just 10 mins walk from the centre of St. Helier. Its in a lovely location with good views. It has lots of facilities with good conference rooms. The staff and friendly and helpful. Good food and bars,5
"This was my third stay at the Hotel du Franc and it continues to amaze me. On this occasion we upgraded our room to a balcony and considering the wonderful weather it was well worth the experience and the more modern rooms in the spa extension were adorable. Made use of the on site spa, swimming, sauna etc and the breakfast offering is among the best I have experienced. Garden restaurant is well priced, Lounge Bar is wonderful relaxing way to end the day. For those into diverse cuisine Saffrons Restaurant is available for Fusion food.",5
Our friends had asked me to organise a short stay in Jersey and so I booked all seven of us at this hotel.  My husband and I had stayed here last August and loved it so I was fairly confident they  would like it here too.  I was correct - they loved it.  We had a thoroughly good time exploring Jersey during the day and it was great to come back and spend time winding down in and around the pool.  Robes are provided in the rooms so you could put your costume on in your room and walk to and from the pool in your robe.    Of course a few of us did manage an early morning swim before breakfast!  The rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.  There is a good choice of food and drink at the Garden View Restaurant at decent prices too.  Breakfast was well catered for including full…,5
"Fabulous hotel and staff, the rooms are immaculate and the breakfasts lovely,great choice.All the staff we met were helpful and genuinely seemed to enjoy their work.The hotel is in a great location with excellent facilities and great value for money",5
"We recommend this hotel if your a looking for a perfect place to stay. The swimming pool is just amazing. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast is delicious. We appreciated the supermarket close too the Hotel. Very handy for last-minute shopping. We will come back as soon as possible. Our son told us about Jersey and about the Hotel, he was right, this was a fabulous experience. ",5
"We have just spent 4 nights here in this beautiful hotel. The staff were an absolute delight, welcoming, professional, helpful and genuinely interested and invested in ensuring you were having an amazing stay. We had a fabulously spacious room(233) with a huge bed, seating area and a beautiful bathroom with spacious shower and bath. Everything was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished. We enjoyed the generous buffet breakfast and the bar terrace where we were able to enjoy the lovely spring weather. The well equipped gym and fabulous pool and spa facilities were wonderful. We had planned to have treatments in the spa but the weather was so lovely we decided to leave them as a treat for next time! Check out the menu at the in house restaurant,  Saffrons. We ate there twice,…",5
"Excellent service, attention to detail, and warm and welcoming service from all employees.  This really is a great hotel.  The staff are so friendly, recognising us from previous visits, and take time to talk and find out how we are.  The SPA is just amazing, absolutely love it.  There isn't an aspect of the hotel that you can complain about.  We are really looking forward to returning in July.",5
"It looked good on the internet and it certainly was. We arrived early planning to leave our cases and return later only to be told our room was ready so we checked in and by  10.30a.m. we were heading into town. A nice steady walk into town took us 15 minutes, the shuttle bus from the hotel was very good if you wanted to go out at the times it ran. There is a bit of an incline up to the hotel but certainly nowhere near as bad as I had thought it might be from previous reviews. The hotel itself is lovely, the food very good and the staff so friendly and helpful. The pool area was delightful, excellent facilities and at 7.00a.m. I had the pool to myself.",5
"A good place for a break with a lovely pool area to relax and unwind. Good, friendly staff and a great restaurant in Saffrons made our stay memorable. The hotel is big and quite bitty, with different styles added to the grand old building, but overall a pleasant place for its size.",4
"Difficult to fault this really rather grand hotel. The staff seem to be uniformly helpful and friendly, the place is very clean and tidy, and impressive. Only 100 rooms or so, across four floors, but both times, ours have been a good size and full of all the things you’d expect. Each time the main restaurant has been closed but food and wine in the all day restaurant is good value and well cooked. Plenty of free parking, which in St Helier is a real plus. I think it’s a terrific hotel - it just seems to be in the wrong part of town. The immediate surrounding certainly don’t do justice to its Palais de Versailles appearance. Oh, and breakfast, although a buffet style, was really rather good.  The only gripe was being charged a quid for a cheap toothbrush and about 2 ml of…",4
"This is the best hotel,I have ever been to . It was spotless, the room was huge the staff were so lovely at all times . The view from the room was stunning . And it was reasonably priced as well . The restaurant in the hotel was good as well and the breakfast was a huge choice ...everything about our holiday was brilliant..we will be back",5
Spa rooms are worth paying that little extra for. Breakfast was excellent and customer service seemed to be at the top of the staffs agenda. Will definitely be booking again when we travel back to the island to visit family. ,5
I have never seen a smaller or more inferior piece of smoked haddock which considering  an additional charge was made was extremely poor value. Otherwise the breakfast buffet was very good with a great selection.. ,3
We have stayed here many times this time taking our children. We had two large interconnecting rooms which I would choose again. The pool is amazing as is the terrace. Looking forward to our next stay.,5
"I’m a returning guest and could be viewed as bias but this is truly a great hotel! I phone direct and get an answer to my request immediately. Staff are great. Facilities superb. Spa, gym AND parking - what more? ",5
"We have used this hotel on many occasions over the last 10 years, both for business and weekend breaks.  The spa rooms are lovely and spacious with balconies. Not a tremendous view but nice enough.  We were lucky to have nice weather so enjoyed a few drinks on the terrace. Staff are polite and helpful.  The pool area is nice, very relaxing with a good sized pool and separate sauna/steam room/hot & cold therapy pools.  We decided to eat in Saffrons - I will review that separately but wow! Definitely worth a visit.  Breakfast is good - a great selection of hot buffet and continental items.   All in all, a fantastic hotel which we will continue to use.",5
"The hotel is very clean and spacious! We were made very welcome when we checked in, we got in our room and had a great view of st hellier and the sunsets. The room was very clean with tea/coffee facilities, we had a spa treatment booked and that was great but we went into the pools and jacuzzi which all felt cold! We booked to eat in saffron’s not realising how expensive it was (£16 starter) if we had eaten there it would have cost £160 a couple without drinks, with this said I would go back to the hotel again. Breakfast selection was fantastic there was hot/cold and all the pastries that you could eat, the garden view restaurant was very reasonably priced and the afternoon teas were great.",4
What can I say ! Excellent value for money Best Spa in Jersey. Comfy beds and nice view. Good on site restaurant’s. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice location for short walk to town centre ( keep some energy for the walk back though),4
Great hotel but a bit of a walk into st helier with a steep slope back up to the hotel. Really nice room and great breakfast and nice restaurant for the evening/lunchtime. Beautiful spa area with plenty of loungers ,5
Loved it really enjoyed our stay the staff were very helpful hotel was clean and lots to do there really enjoyed the pool very relaxing and prices in the bar were the same as in town so all good food was first class breakfast is superb will not go anywhere else in jersey ,5
"129 room hotel. Very clean, spacious but bedroom had blackout blinds but no curtains or artwork so was a bit bland. Very wide corridors. Great breakfast buffet but soul less. Bar also a little characterless. Very comfortable bed and good location slightly out of town on a hill.",4
"Had a great stay at Hotel de France. It is a more traditional hotel than some in St. Helier, certainly in style of decor in the main areas but do not let this put you off. It is really comfortable, a great pool and spa, fabulous bar with cream leather chairs and breakfast to suit all tastes. While some of the bedrooms are not as modern as other hotels, it is spotless and the in room amenities were great. Above all, the staff are so helpful and friendly. Plus the free shuttle into St. Helier is really convenient. ",4
"A grand old building with an 80/90s interior, rather boring.  My pleasant, well furnished  room had a rear view into roof tops and scrubby gardens.  Nice room, very clean, good bathroom, comfy bed.  Really good breakfast, nice pool.  Whole hotel is rather charachterless and uninspiring.  Restaurant and bar very quiet.  Ate the special of 'filet of plaice with an amazing zingy lemon and lime sauce'   NOT REALLY rather a boring poached fillet of plaice with a smear of rather boring sauce, not a zing in site.  So nice hotel, good access to town though steep hill, good value and comfort with large indoor pool for a very pleasant stay.",4
"Stayed here whilst exhibiting at the Jersey HE Convention in March. One of the most stunning hotels I've ever stayed in (and believe me, I stay in a good few.) The staff are outstanding with everything they do and nothing is ever too much. Although the hotel definitely has high-class elements, they make you feel welcome at all times. The rooms were spotless and offered great views of St. Helier! Brilliant breakfast too! Would whole-heartedly recommend!",5
"If you have difficulty walking the access to the hotel from the road has a steep hill to climb, so wouldn't choose this hotel. There is a free car park if you are driving, in which case you could park there and it would be OK to access the hotel on foot.   Although the spa area is nice as you can see from the photos. Sadly, the rest of the hotel is a little dated. My room was tiny and had been pushed up against the radiator. I have never slept beside a radiator in a hotel? A little jig around would prove beneficial. I have just entered the spa area and taken three towels. One for laying on the lounger with, one to dry myself with and another as I'm going home today and need to shower, so would need a clean extra towel? I have just been stopped and told only two towels allowed…",3
Strangely dated decor through most of the hotel but with a very stylish spa and gym and a good bistro type restaurant the Garden View. Initial welcome was a little stiff and formal though efficient but service and staff proved helpful and pleasant. Worthy of special mention were Christina who runs the Garden View restaurant and Costi one of he colleagues. Both were pleasant attentive and very able.,4
"I booked a three day two night wedding anniversary break through B.A. City breaks, this hotel was in a number of choices, I am glad I chose The Hotel de France. On approach it looks like a grand old French villa, on entering the lobby area you could see at first glance this is a very good place to stay. It was spotlessly clean, the check in staff were polite and efficient and very helpful during our stay. Our bedroom (214) was clean, bright and looked as if it had not long been re-decorated. We had a fantastic view overlooking the gardens and out to the sea. As a guest at the Hotel you have use of the facilities, infinity pool, steam room and sauna all of which are tip top. The restaurants and bars which serve food are of a very high standard, it is advisable to book at the…",5
The service & facilities are so good I have been coming to this Hotel for a few years now and will be continuing to come back again and again as love the Spa & massage treatments and the great food and ofcourse the friendly helpful staff that make my stay a happy home from home experience.,5
"Which so many options for accommodation on the island, shortlisting can be a challenge. But if you’re looking for somewhere in a good location for exploring the main town and with decent facilities, this hotel should be high on your list. It’s about a ten minute walk into the main shopping area of the town and twenty to the main harbour area. It’s a pleasant walk too with some nice buildings to admire along the way, although bear in mind the hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle service too. If it’s a busy day allow yourself about half an hour by car from the airport.  The hotel has it’s own driveway from the main road, which doesn’t look like much from the bottom but leads up to a fairly impressive entrance and lobby area. Despite arriving late in the evening the greeting…",4
"We came to Hotel de France for a girlie catch up and we loved it. The staff, accommodation, spa and food were all fantastic and we will be back to stay in May. Thank you for making a birthday celebration a great one. ",5
"Nice hotel. Rooms clean etc. Very nice old fashioned décor inside the communal areas. The on site Spa was superb. Great facilities. Lovely bar area for after dinner drinks. Very prompt room service. Breakfast buffet was good. Great produce, very tasty bacon and sausages that were cooked to perfection. Only criticism was the room service menu late at night. When feeling peckish and fancy a midnight snack, bean stew isn't on the list of things I've ever fancied. Sneakily ordered Domino's delivery....sorry!",4
I found this hotel to be old and dated and in need of major modernisation. The rooms are dated the bedding is cheap. There is no minibar in the room which I find incredible for a 4 star hotel. The breakfast is a very depressing experience. Total lack of ambience and below average food. The staff circle you as you eat looking to clear plates which I found made me feel on edge. The music and layout of the room leave a lot to be desired. I wouldn’t return if I were to come to jersey again. One positive is the friendly staff ,3
"This hotel is deservedly rated as one of Jersey's best It is a very large hotel with an imposing facade and an equally impressive interior. We had a large pleasant room with a view overlooking Elizabeth Castle. Saffrons, one of the in house restaurants is excellent and we enjoyed our buffet style breakfasts in the orangery styled breakfast room. A very pleasant stay and would stay here again. ",5
"Staff very friendly and efficient. Nothing is too much trouble. Gorgeous food in all the restaurants and very attentive staff. My husband booked Saffron’s for my birthday. We had a complimentary glass of bubbly. The food is more expensive in there, but for a special occasion was worth it.  My husband in gluten intolerant. The menus catered for this in all the restaurants.  Didn’t use the free shuttle service because the walk into town was pleasant using side streets. On the way back it’s steep the last 200 yds The pool area is fantastic and very relaxing.  The only small criticism is the instant coffee sachets in the room. Didn’t like the taste, but I am a filter coffee drinker.   Our room was on the 4th floor giving us a panoramic of the town towards the sea.  Would we return?…",5
"We recently had a lovely weekend at the Hotel de France as a group of 9 occupying 4 rooms. All the rooms were lovely, and excellent value for money. My Daughter, Son in law, and Grandson  ( nearly 2 years old) stayed in The Aubin Suite which was very spacious and having a separate sitting room , was perfect for them as they did not have to sit quietly in the dark once my Grandson had gone tosleep, The spa rooms were nicely furnished and had lovely views over St Helier. We usually stay in the centre of town, but found it to be more peaceful during the night here. The spa was very well equipped and very relaxing. We hope to be back soon!",5
"My relaxing break was enhanced by the friendly, caring very helpful staff in the Hotel and Spa. I would highly recommend this Hotel!  Lovely, quiet room. It was very clean and there was a useful shuttle into town. Peaceful Hotel and great Spa. ",5
"Lovely food at Garden View Restaurant very modern clean room and lots of breakfast options, beautiful spa! Will definitely stay again perfect for couples, only issue was balcony door did not open maybe broken or just locked ",4
Have stayed here many times over the last 15 years and it never disappoints. Very friendly and helpful staff .food is always excellent. Would strongly recommend to anyone. 5 star treatment. Courtesy  bus is a good idea to get in to St helier. I will be back again later in the year.it always feels fantastic when we check in,5
"This was a return visit after visiting and staying here about two years ago we thought then we would return and so we did. Same excellent service and such a relaxing atmosphere,thanks to all the staff who work so hard to maintain the good service. The food and spa as usual were first class. We feel a good value break for the quality of service. We are definitely not ruling out another visit in the future! We love it. Thank you 👍",5
"Had an overnight stay here recently, original booked dinner in garden view restaurant,but as it was our anniversary asked if it was possible to dine at Saffrons. Spoke with dep manager Alan Andrews who explained that although they were fully booked he spoke to restaurant and managed to squeeze us in , very much appreciated. So impressive to deal with staff who have excellent customer care at heart.The meal  and service were fabulous and certainly made it a night to remember . Big thank you to all the staff who helped us celebrate our special day and look forward to returning soon",4
"What a disappointment, we booked afternoon tea and adviser that one guest didn't eat meat, we arrived at the said time 35 minutes later our tea arrived, then the sandwiches , which were three strips of stale bread, one had a low grade stringy smoked salmon in, one cheese which looked like a strip of a cheese square, no pickle no tomato , one with egg mayo which was very thinly spread,  then our cakes scones etc arrived, no offer of clean plates or cuterlry , no spoon for eating mini tiramisu , cream, no cake. Fork, only a regular fork,. Scones were lovely, fruit tart and sq of chocolate moose cake all lovely,  we then asked for more tea which came about 15 minutes later, no offer of clean cups. Altogether what we called an underwhelming experience ! We shan't  be returning",3
"My partner and I stayed over for one night. The room was lovely and big. We also had two days in the spa’s pool which was great, it includes: a big warm water pool, a massage pool, a cold water rejuvenation pool and another warm water pool that is shallow. Also including a sauna and steam room. Just wish they had a hot jacuzzi. The breakfast in the morning was really nice. Lots of options, everything people would want at breakfast. Served between 7am to 10am. ",4
"Style,  friendly staff, very good quality food, everything was great. The spa is a very special  place for a treatment relaxing, massage. Etc. If you want to relax beautiful pool. I go back many times and would recommend this lovely hotel x",5
"Stayed here recently for my wife’s 50th B’Day celebration. Our hotel suite was very spacious in the new wing, spotlessly clean and well appointed. The staff are very friendly and are happy to go the extra mile. A free shuttle bus into town was also very welcome. The Spa facilities were excellent, a great way to relax and be pampered. Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5
"A very comfortable, fairly large hotel. not a business hotel with the same old décor, but with a few different quirks. Spa on site with swimming pool open to guests at long hours. Spa a little on the expensive side. I was there out of season, so services were a little restricted, but it did mean it was quite quiet and you didn't feel rushed or pushed on to make space. Parking on site, but I imagine this will fill fast during the season although the hotel is only about a 15 minute walk into St Helier and the only hill-climbing is the approach up to the hotel. Two things niggled: in-room drinks did not include decaffeinated coffee, so bring your own (or nip round to the supermarket 5 minutes away) and acquire some artificial sweeteners from breakfast as the housekeepers don't seem…",4
"Great, relaxing spa and lovely room for our girlie get together! Had a lovely lunch in the garden room and a good nights sleep in the large bedroom. Only down side was breakfast in the garden room as the orangerie was being refurbished so wasn’t able to cope with the number of guests. Should be finished by end of feb though. ",5
My husband and I have stayed at the hotel twice now.  On both occasions we really enjoyed our stay here.  The spa is a great addition to the hotel.  The hotel feels welcoming and has a certain charm about it (maybe because it doesn't belong to a huge chain). The service we have received has always been courteous and professional. We would certainly return and highly recommend.,4
"A very good alternative to staying in the centre of town yet only ten or fifteen minutes walk away from the centre of St Helier.  Excellent value, very good staff and an ambience that is well above average and indeed elegant.",5
stayed here for 2 nights with my mum. Our room was a twin & much bigger than we expected. The room was clean with a lovely big bathroom with nice decoration. we used the pool a couple of time while there which was a nice added bonus. The hotel is on the edge of town but is an easy 15 min walk in to town but the hill up to the hotel is a bit steep on the way back. breakfast was very nice. The staff were all friendly & helpful.,4
"Had a good stay here, large well appointed hotel with very good spa facilities. Good restaurants, but limited in January closure periods. Room very comfortable and clean as usual. Very helpful staff - a good place",5
"Another fantastic stay. Always stay at Hotel De France when I visit Jersey. Unbeatable value includes gym, swimming pool etc. Brilliant!! Other hotels for the same star rating are sometimes double the price! Little bit out of the way of town centre but is better for evenings as you don’t have the noise of the road in your room. ",5
"Stayed here last night just as a one of treat. Very pleasantly surprised! We were greeted by freindly helpful faces at the reception desk. Room was great, plenty big enough, lovely view, clean and we had a great view over St Helier. We then went down to the spa to go swimming and we could not believe how nice the pool area is. One huge and deep swimming pool, one deep relaxing pool with jacuzzi bubbles and hot and cold plunge pools. Sauna and steam room were really nice too. If you like swimming then this is the hotel for you! We ate at the garden view reastarant in the evening and the meal was lovely and very reasonably priced. Overall this is a great hotel and worth a visit!!!",5
"Fantastic stay at the Hotel de France, well located and with ample available parking.  The spa was brilliant and was open until quite late. Never too busy and we could always get a lounger. It was the perfect place to relax after a long day sightseeing and travelling around the island.  Breakfast was great and set us up for the day.  Our room was massive with a large balcony from where we watched the Jersey Air Show during our stay in September 2016.  Tickets for parking in Jersey can be purchased at the kiosk in the hotel.",5
Wonderful setting for our Firm's Christmas Event. Second year in a row. Brilliant atmosphere well appointed rooms excellent facilities and very attentive and polite staff. All told a super venue for any event or short stay.,5
The whole experience of staying at this hotel was just what I needed even tho it was for just one night the room was comfortable and spacious clean with everything you would need excellent facilities food and staff were great,5
"Very friendly and helpful staff in an impressive  place.  There is a range of good food and a great spa.  The location is very convenient for St Helier. It's not cheap but it's good value. Treat yourself, you'll be glad you did ",5
Lovely hotel with great amenities - just be aware that the gym closes at 5pm on weekends which seems a bit early. pool is still available though. The pool area was really lovely and a good size a sensible pool that you can actually swim in.,5
"Gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, beautiful rooms but the food was an absolute disgrace. Everything was stone cold, my chicken in my wrap was like rubber so chewy and my breakfast was freezing - eggs were undercooked and cold. It took the shine off what would have been a lovely staff. Staff were so nice and helpful.  ",2
"Stayed as my office Xmas party was held there. Great deal on the room. Able to use Spa and Gym which are top quality. Friendly staff, Hotel is nicely presented. Comfortable room and the food throughout was decent. Parking outside and far enough out of town not to be noisy.",5
"We stayed there for a weekend away from London. Walking distance to everything 10-15 mins. The rooms are ok and bathroom too. The hotel, maybe due to its size looks a bit dated in certain place and possibly lacking of TLC, but don't let that comment make you look away. The staff was generally friendly. The breakfast was disorganised on both mornings we were there. I was very happily surprised with the Spa and the pool. I swim a bit and was very happily surprised with the pool length and water temperature.",4
"Hotel very clean and a good location , the spa is great, breakfast very good , I will stay again and would recommend to anyone going to jersey on business . As I need soya milk it’s put in my room in a fridge ",5
We stayed for two nights in this hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel has a brilliant spa facility. Good choice at the buffet breakfast. Some of the hotel is clearly very old and did not seem to be currently used. The one disappointment of the stay was the meal we had in the hotel. The service was very slow and the food not great. But on the whole this did not dampen a good stay.,5
"Arriving late, tired and hungry due to the ferry being delayed, the warm welcome by the receptionist was only surpassed by her arranging for our bags to be sent to the room while we rushed to the restaurant with minutes to spare. The waiters then gave no indication that we were causing a problem and a wonderful meal was had with perfect service.",5
"This hotel has one of the best Spa’s I have been to, and is definitely the best in Jersey. The gym and Healthhaus are worth a visit, the changing rooms are always clean and a decent size. The staff are always welcoming and friendly. Both restaurants are excellent with a great range of food for all budgets, and Saffron’s is worth a visit for their excellent top end Indian food experience. The bedrooms are of a good size and comfortable mattress on the bed. As it is set back from the main town it is very quiet at the hotel. Our favourite hotel in Jersey!",5
"Very high quality furnishings and fittings inside, well fitted out; very good facilities.  Staff friendly, courteous and helpful. However, outside, the original gardens have been built on, and an enormous health centre/clinic now obstructs the original facade.  The driveways to and from the hotel go round this clinic building but with little or no lighting after dark, which is very unhelpful for anyone making their way in or out on foot at night.",4
"The hotel has an old fashioned feel, in a good way. It is comfortable and has excellent staff. The best aspect of it is the new wing, which accommodates the excellent spa and the best rooms. Slightly out of town, which is not a problem if one has a car.",4
"Great hotel, lovely and clean rooms. The staff are really friendly and make you feel welcome.  It’s only a short walk into town. The only criticism is that the menu in the restaurant can get a bit repetitive.  Overall great hotel.",4
"We stayed twice in this hotel for business recently for a total of11 days. We stayed in a spa room which was very spacious with a good desk for work. Excellent bathrooms and facilities. Dining was good, the staff in the restaurant were helpful, especially Christina, although service was slow at times. Breakfast also good although they do struggle to keep the food hot at times. The spa is fantastic and a perfect place to relax after work, definitely a reason to pick this hotel. Short walk into town but a bit more difficult on the return as a hill involved. Thanks to all at the hotel for looking after us.",4
Early check in was available which was fantastic.  Room was large and airy. It was a little chilly due to a drop in outside temperature. We called reception to advise and they immediately sent someone up with a portable heater which made all the difference. All staff pleasant and helpful.  Would definitely recommend. ,5
"I spent quite some time researching a hotel choice for a romantic weekend break in Jersey with my partner and I decided on this hotel, I paid £99 for 1 night (Saturday, mid November), through booking.com. The lobby was nice enough if a little dated, but we were extremely disappointed when we got to our room. Whilst I was aware that we had booked the cheapest room available, it just wasn’t what I had expected from a 4 star hotel. The bedroom and the bathroom were tiny, I have stayed in far larger rooms at the likes of travelodge/premier inn etc. There was nothing remotely special about the room, everything looked worn and dated, and small details such as the blind mechanism being held together with sellotape just confirmed our thoughts that we didn’t want to spend a romantic…",3
The hotel building itself is impressive. It’s a bit up the hill but that gives you a superb view of the city. I stayed on the second floor with sea view at far end.   It’s a short walk to the town. A supermarket is just nearby. There is shuttle service to the town as well. I love the spa and indoor pool. It’s so relaxed.   Breakfast is one of the highlights. There is a wide range of high quality food and food is refilled promptly. Staff are friendly and helpful.   Room is on a small side but good for one person. Shower is great and the room is spotless. Can’t wait to stay again! ,5
This was a great hotel . Staff can not do enough for you . It was clean tidy at all times and the spa was spotless. Breakfast was good - could have been a bit better for the hot side of the food on offer but it did not put us off.   Reception staff were first class if you asked a question and they did not know they researched and came back to our room with information.,5
"The hotel is very large and provides all services you would expect. For the cost the new rooms are very nice. The Spa though is a case of ‘style over substance’ the service is extremely rude and the facilities don’t seem to make sense. Jacuzzi not quite warm up to have any therapeutic benefit and the bubbled area was only standing, so impossible to relax. A small, shallow (1/2 a metre) hot water pool, but no bubbles and in the dark. Relaxation room closed. Showers not premium, push button (5-10 second last) a spa should have rainforest/monsoon showers. Not the type you have in your local football club changing room. Actual swimming pool, same temperature as the jacuzzi. Makes no sense. On the other hand the healthhaus Gym was excellent, modern, clean and very knowledgable. I…",3
"We did an overnight spa package, which includes dinner, breakfast, a treatment and unlimited use of the lovely spa facilities. I would highly recommend it. Our room was large, nicely furnished and extremely comfortable. It was a highly enjoyable escape.",5
"We stayed here last weekend (Friday 27th October-Sunday 29th October) . We went for my daughter's 30th birthday celebration. We were all thoroughly impressed with the hotel, and the staff were lovely. I had emailed the hotel to ask if a bottle of prosecco could be put in my daughter's bedroom for our arrival. We were thrilled to see the prosecco plus a card printed out with details of who it was from, also we were given lovely rooms with huge beds at the front of the hotel. We were totally impressed. We ate just breakfast in the hotel but again we were impressed with variety and quality of the food. We had a few drinks in the lounge bar and were happy with prices charged and variety on offer. We had booked a full days tour with a coach company. They were a little later picking…",5
"Hotel de France is a beautiful hotel with helpful and friendly staff, the rooms are lovely and comfortable, and the breakfast is great.  The Ayush pool and spa are pure luxury  Our number one hotel in Jersey ",5
Used a suite to get ready for our wedding day and stayed a total of 2 nights. Plenty of room for the bridesmaids and I to get dressed and the make up artist to work her magic! Breakfast was lovely and the staff throughout were great. Had champagne left for us when we got back from the reception which was a kind touch. The spa was a wonderful retreat after the late night but I would say that the gym goers use the lockers so there weren’t any available to residents when we were there. The spa manager was rather blunt with us and said we should have changed in our room but we had checked out already to be efficient!,5
"Excellent hotel experience which lived up to high expectations.  We made good use of the great, modern spa facilities and enjoyed the excellent views from our rooms balcony. Quality breakfast.  Highly recommend",5
"We took advantage of all possibilities offered by the hotel : spa , restaurants , parking for the car , location close to the center of St Hellier etc ... Staff was helpful and very professional . Our two rooms met our expectations .",5
"Room was nice however bathroom should of been of higher standards considering a 4 star hotel. Majority of staff nice however one staff member interfered with a conversation I was having with my partner which I found extremely rude and unprofessional. Spa facilities were excellent. Lovely, smiley young boy at entrance of spa. Female spa receptionist older looking not as friendly and quite stern and not very welcoming.",3
"Really enjoyed our stay, we did not use the hotel shuttle bus as it did not run very often. It's a shame as the local bus company runs from town to the airport for £2.00 pp against £16 to £20.00 for a taxi",5
"If visiting the Island with your car plenty of on site parking ,The  Mini bus service to town is great,  Staff always there to assist. Food is very good and reasonable price. A super indoor swimming pool and Spar is attached to the Hotel",5
"Staff were very friendly and accommodating, I requested early check in and was not a problem. Rooms were clean and beds were lovely and comfy. Spa was amazing! One of the best in Jersey! Overall great experience ",5
"Amazing hotel, very helpful and friendly staff. Would highly recommend it weather for business or pleasure. The spa facilities are first class and just a short walk into town. The restaurants serve some delicious food too.",5
"Great hotel, excellent amenities, clean room, we had room service deliver an evening meal...let down by having mayonnaise and tomato ketchup served with Lamb Shank!!!! Really? What happened to the good old mint sauce or if you want to be really posh, Red current Jelly? Breakfast though is very good with plenty of choice for everyone",5
Lovely hotel good service fabulous spa although a a walk into town and the beach a shuttle bus service runs throughout the day  lovely sun terrace restaurant saffron was very good  a different experience worth trying although a little bit expensive ,5
A very pleasant hotel with superb leisure facilities admittedly not in the most convenient location but for any car drivers there is free on-site parking available. I will aim to stay there whenever I am in Jersey.,5
"Definitely not a 4 star experience for us.  I understand other rooms were better quality but our rooms were very small and in need of refurbishment.  We were above a kitchen with accompanying noise and smells and a view of a wall. My door was temperamental and I spent a lot of time waiting in a corridor for someone to come and open my door.  Irritating to have numerous members of staff tell me I must have put the key by my phone - I hadn't, on any of the occasions!!!  The 'duty manager' did turn up to talk to us eventually but was not empowered to help satisfactorily because all she could do was offer another grotty room.  The restaurant only offered an over priced tasting menu on the Sunday evening which was sub-optimal and the staff there were unfriendly and humourless.  I…",1
Hotel is nice and comfortable  Staff friendly and efficient Health club is absolutely fantastic with exceptional facilities and range of equipment  Spa lovely but a bit expensive  Indian restaurant very good ,4
"stayed here early October for an overnight business stay. Check in was quick and I was given my room on 4th floor, rooms are a little dated but ok for me, bathroom could also do with updating too. Health club and pools are great at his hotel, probably why I stay here!  ate in the bar restaurant and service was quick and polite, food good as usual. breakfast was buffet style and I was surprised to see that they now charge a supplement for an omelette! surely this type of hotel should not be doing that! ?? overall a pleasant stay and I will probably stay here again when next in Jersey....but please loose the breakfast supplement!",4
"Booked for parents 50th anniversary. Staff were brilliant and went above and beyond, fantastic room, great food and lots of extras in their room including Prosecco, flowers and a basket of fruit.  making their celebration even more special. THANK YOU",5
"Can't fault this hotel. From the rooms, the spa and the food in the downstairs restaurant. The staff are always friendly and accommodating. This is our 4th stay, and each time it's as good as the first ",5
"Stayed here for last minute mini break with family. Hotel is very dated and in need of refurbishing, we visited many years ago and still same decor. Saying this rooms and general hotel clean, staff friendly in most of Hotel, unfortunately not so in lounge bar in fact rather stuffy and most unhelpful. Saffron restaurant was rather expensive for this hotel. Spa is very good with again helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast room more like canteen with ok breakfast if you like rubber eggs. We found on last day you were able to request poached eggs but would of been helpful if they informed guests. We would not return, Hotel more suited to the older generation except for Spa. Treatments expensive but lovely. ",3
"I'm a simple man with simple requirements when I take lodgings in a hotel room.   Clean sheets on my bed, clean towels and hot water.  This hotel successfully failed at two.   On entering the room I pulled the sheets back and the flat sheet had what appeared to be black makeup and black hairs on it. (See attached photos).  Yes Management apologized and changed the sheets, the point is, how hard is it to put a clean sheet on the bed.  Then at midnight I had a shower and the towel was stained.  Come on, get the basics correct. It's not that hard!  The positives for this hotel is that it had good views from my room window, the fact that they managed to supply hot water and it's located away from the Street.",3
"Lovely hotel. We stayed for a few days for our 60th birthday.  Our room  on top floor at front of hotel was very nice with views across the town and the garden. Breakfast was adequate and we had some nice meals in the restaurant although not of a great choice. The bar lounge lacked atmosphere there was hardly anyone around but at breakfast time there were lots of people in the breakfast room where were they in the evenings?, Basically it was dull in the evenings. The hotel is quite a walk from St Helier, a shuttle bus is available. The Spa was fantastic and we had some treatments and generally chilled out there.  I think this was one of the main attractions for us. Don't stay here if you want to be near  bars and restaurants and can't walk up hills.  But do stay here if you love…",4
"Enjoyed a weekend at Jersey staying in this hotel.   The room was decent but not perhaps the same quality as many other hotels I've stayed in at this price bracket. The family room seemed like just a standard room with another single bed crammed in.  The hotel lift is a bit dodgy - it can hold only three people and goes really slowly.  The spa is nice, perhaps slightly above average in terms of the pools available.  Staff were friendly and helpful at all times.  The breakfast was a bit of a let down. The sausage and bacon was really poor quality. Normally in hotels of this stature decent ingredients are used. Because the breakfast was so poor we opted not to eat in the restaurant. I wonder how many people came to the same conclusion as us?  Some details of the hotel were just…",3
This is our idea of the perfect hotel! The rather grand building is well appointed and beautifully kept. Staff are friendly and efficient and seem genuinely interested in delivering a high quality service. Dining options include an informal and competitively priced menu. The breakfast buffet is outstanding both in terms of choice and quality. The spa is an absolute haven - the best we've encountered so far. Thanks for a wonderful experience. We'd love to visit again! ,5
"Very much enjoyed our spa room and using the pool, sauna jacuzzi etc very relaxing., have stayed in other room too which was good. Easy walk into town 10-15 minutes. Breakfast was ok, good selection of fruit and cereals., but didn't rate the hot breakfast very much.",4
"Great hotel, fantastic building, brilliant spa, great staff, great breakfast, great room.  All round excellent but the steps up from the main road after a bottle of red in a local restaurant are to put it mildly daunting :-)",5
A lovely hotel with a good feel about it.  The beds were comfortable and the staff friendly. A very good selection of food for breakfast. The Spa was brilliant to use after a day out. If there was a criticism to be made it is that it would be nice to have a bit of relaxing music in the background of the Spa as it was a lovely place to be. Two very nice Restaurants although only used the cheaper of the two with a good choice of menu.  A very nice lounge bar to relax and have a drink.,5
"An excellent hotel with first class accommodation. A good breakfast with a wide selection of food from which to choose All restaurants are a very high standard. The Spa was an added bonus to our trip, a very relaxing experience with the added chance for a swim. The gym gave the chance to keep up with an exercise routine.",5
"From check in to check out, could not fault the hotel, breakfast was good every morning, we only ate once in the evening, in the saffron restaurant, which was superb. The pool area is one of the best I have ever seen.",5
Another excellent experience. Having the pool and gym is a massive bonus to used throughout your stay.  The room price is outstanding compared to other local establishments of the same rating. Food was excellent as always. Fantastic stay.,5
"A delightful hotel with good facilities run by staff who genuinely care for their guest experience. Not only are the staff friendly and efficient, they also care for the establishment they work for as if they were part of the family that own it The hotel infrastructure was wonderfully clean and well kept ;  Right from the roof, the imposing columns, the patio furniture, the room carpets, the shower flex hose even! Although not the most modern fittings everywhere, everything was as well looked after as in your own home. An excellent environment to stay in with views over a well-kept garden with lovely green lawn and a quiet spot too, away from most traffic noise, all contribute to an overall satisfying experience.",5
"Our first visit to the island and the Hotel was an excellent base from which to explore.  We enjoyed the pool and spa complex and our breakfast was excellent,  Staff were friendly and very helpful, Overall our stay was a great success and we would like to return one day.",5
"Enjoyed a lovely relaxing break for our wedding anniversary at the H De F. We found all the staff to be friendly,helpful and courteous.  Our room was very comfortable ,had a large window overlooking the Town and a settee to relax and take in the view.  A nice touch was a bottle of bubbly on ice waiting for us in the room on arrival courtesy of the Hotel and much appreciated. We will return at some point.",5
"The hotel is beautiful and it has a story attached to it. The rooms are lovely with comfy beds. The breakfast was also lovely. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The spa is absolutely amazing, very high-end though. ",5
Stayed for one night in October. Impressive grounds and facade. Very well kept inside and out. Never used the facilities but that's my problem I'm regretting that. Walking distance to town centre and they run a shuttle bus. First world thing to review but the wifi was excellent. Would certainly stay again. ,4
"Nice large room with good views over St Helier, though the balcony needs something to stop small objects falling onto the floors below. Friendly, helpful staff, the usual ""serve yourself"" breakfasts. But the dining rooms let the hotel down. The Saffron Restaurant is really inappropriate - and expensive - in a 4 star hotel, and not suitable for everyone's palate. The Garden restaurant suffers from a fixed menu with only one ""special"" every day, so gets boring after a few days. Where are the traditional dishes like roasts and grills? The Spa is very nice, though quite busy most of the time.",4
Top class Hotel with good size comfortable rooms and excellent Buffett breakfast. The Spa without a doubt was the best I've seen in a Hotel. The in house restaurants are expensive and we found better value eating in town. It's a good 20 minute walk into town and there is very little near the hotel. The only downside of staying here is a lack of atmosphere in the evenings no entertainment and very few residents using the cocktail bar probably because of the prices.,4
"The Hotel De France is a wonderful Hotel the rooms were spotless. we made use of the swimming pool ,sauna and Jacuzzi whilst staying there, all recently renovated , the breakfast was excellent with no shortage of selections. We also made use of the on-site restaurant, not the indian one , the food was beautiful and it was reasonably priced.",5
"Nice hotel, location is within walking distance of town centre. Customer service is good. Didn't get to use the spa or pool, but it looked nice. Fist nifpght's dinner was terrible, dry lamb dish, hence the low review. Dinner on second night was good. Breakfast selection was also good. ",3
If you like health spa breaks were you can just get away & it doesn't cost a fortune then the hotel de France in jersey Channel Islands is the place . Quick flight 55 minutes pending were you are in the UK . Foods amazing there lots to do . The scenery is fab hotels the people & the beaches Iv been so many times & I never get fed up with up & may I say tottally safe . It's the place for me 👍,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights, great hotel and staff very helpful and friendly, room was lovely and very spacious. Loved the spa! Breakfast area looks a bit tired and run down but great selection of food at breakfast! Will definitely be back",5
Have visited this hotel many times. The standard is always very good but it would be nice if they had a nice cosy and warm bar instead of having to use Saffrons which has little atmosphere and the drinks are very expensive.   ,5
"Spent three nights in this lovely hotel in St Helier. Four star rating , only complaint was breakfast service ordered optional choice and following two reminds received it 30 minutes later by which time I had chosen further choice . ",5
Stayed overnight because attended a very enjoyable and professional Awards dinner.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Parking was good and instructions from airport clear.  Room was small but contained everything we needed except a full length mirror!  ,4
"We have been a visitor to the above hotel for many years and look forward to further visits in the future. The spa and gym are a great attraction and  Safrons, well the meal we had was amazing again. We also had lunches in the bistro and drinks in the bar. The shuttle bus service was great and appreciated.",5
"Excellent facilities. Lovely room. Staff were very nice, nothing was too much trouble. Courtesy bus added bonus. Food good value. The spa was very nice though did not have any treatments. Overall a very nice and relaxing hotel.",5
"Some hotels are never tested past a weekend stay. Everyday was consistently good.The room was good,bed comfortable.Bathroom and shower always worked.Constant hot water and pressure.Two restaurants.Bistro and Indian fusion.Indian Fusion taster menu was superb. Spa was well above average.Decent size swimming pool,Sauna,Steam room and plunge pool.Changing rooms were large with all the usual facilities. ",5
"This is a very large 4 star 126 bedroom hotel over 5 floors set in great grounds behind a health centre, so there is no road noise. There are some minus points;- it is a ten minute drive to the centre of St Helier, or a 20 minute walk. There is a courtesy bus every 90 minutes or so, BUT not on Sundays. There is an infrequent bus service to St. H or you can get a taxi. The one way systems, parking and traffic in Jersey are not good. There is no mini bar or fridge in rooms, but there is tea/ coffee making facilities. The rooms are clean and quite roomy and have a very good Toshiba T.V. There are plenty of sitting areas besides the foyer/ entrance. Room service is 24 hours but add £5 to whatever you order. The breakfast is amazing a buffet of everything bread, rolls, fruit, cooked…",5
"We chose the Hotel de France over many others hotels for our 5 night stay and it was a big of a mixed bag. The actual hotel is lovely.  A grand lobby with sweeping staircase gave a good first impression. The check in was fast and the all the staff we encountered during our stay where polite and professional.  The problem we had was mainly with the room. It was perfectly clean if a little dated with strange white and green tiles in the bathroom ? It had tea and coffee making facilities but there was no mini bar,fridge, or ironing board which I felt was a little odd. For this calibre of hotel these are the givens I’ve come to expect.  The biggest problem however was the bed. It was the most uncomfortable bed I’ve ever had the misfortune to sleep on. It had no support what so ever…",3
"Overall a very large but comfortable hotel.  Its high location above the town provides good views with little traffic noise.  Breakfast service was slick but not rushed.  Reception staff could have been friendlier, not greeting guests when in reception but not an issue.  ",5
"Nice Hotel generally.  Free car parking. 20 mins walk to town,  Difficult to find due to one way streets. .  Nice touch for our anniversary, Prossecco, fruit and flowers in room, unexpected. Cant believe no fridge in nice sea view from of house 4th floor room.  No Ice, no cold water, tap water warm.  Unacceptable. VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Told needed to order ice on room service at £5....NOoooooo.      Poor.  Saffrons good, but expensive, Taster menu and wine ok.   main restaurant ok, nowhere to sit in a bar till 5pm. Sat in restaurant to have wine, WHY???    ...OUTDATED like the island.",3
"We recently stayed at the Hotel de France for four nights. As a 4* hotel we had high expectations - on this occasion we were not disappointed. Our Executive Room had a large bedroom with a sitting area with a sofa and armchair and coffee table. There was a dressing room alongside the bathroom. All were very clean and well laid out. The bed was super comfortable for a good nights sleep. We had room 254 and it looked out over the frontage of the hotel. The hotel itself is large and has a corporate feel to it.. However, the facilities are good with a friendly staff and parking for which there is no charge.  I did advise the reception staff that one of the basins in the bathroom was draining very slowly but at the time of departure I can't say if their maintenance department has…",5
"We were left disappointed with the hotel because it has no character.  The rooms and general interior decor needs work, the breakfast was of average quality.  However, it has an excellent Gym and swimming pool.  The spa is OK but pricey.  Location is ok for St Helier town and has free parking which is good.",3
Courtesy bus available but gets full. Excellent food and very friendly staff buffet breakfast had loads of choice and dreamy Jersey yogurts. Eat in garden view twice and first rate. Good value for money.,4
"Had a three night stay at this hotel recently.  Very well-presented hotel from outside, clean inside with helpful friendly staff and adequate parking spaces. However, our second-floor room and en suite whilst clean, with bedding and towels changed daily, was decidedly dull and lacklustre and not a pleasure to return to after a busy day, the view being that of the conservatory roof. Breakfast selection fine, but on the second morning, the hot food was decidedly cold.....think they had a problem with the system keeping the food warm.  Didn't try the restaurants, so cannot comment, the spa looked lovely, but didn't try that either.  Would not return here, because of the above.",3
The hotel is in a quiet location but the down side of this is that there is a bit of a walk into town. There is a shuttle bus but that might not always fit in with your plans. There is a steep climb to the hotel from the main road. We felt that the quality of the breakfast was disappointing especially the cold buffet.,4
"Certainly would recommend this hotel  Room was excellent, spacious and light, serviced promptly each day Staff were helpful and professional  I would have preferred a served breakfast rather than a buffet",5
Our 7th visit to Hotel de France and were not disappointed. the hotel was fully booked but he staff who never stopped working still managed to be friendly and helpful. Food and facilities are excellent,5
"Gorgeous hotel, spa is fabulous, food was beautiful, all the staff were really helpful and friendly! The bathroom was pretty basic - which is why I've given 4 out of 5 stars but everything else was perfect!",4
"Lovely large bedroom (spa room with balcony) and bathroom, very clean and fresh with great views across St Helier to the sea. Good facilities in bedroom. Staff very friendly and helpful. Reasonable selection at breakfast. Pleasant bar and good restaurant. Hotel was in a great location for us as a group of 6 friends as it was out of the town centre so quiet and relaxed and a 20 - 30 minute walk into town - ideal walk after a great meal in any of the many excellent restaurants in town. The Spa treatments seemed a bit pricey compared to those in other similar standard hotels in mainland uk but pool area nice, clean and reasonably good facilities.",5
"This is an impressive hotel with a huge and spacious reception area, dominated by a lovely winding staircase. Rooms are reasonably sized, and well appointed. The hotel location is good - a easy 30 minute walk from the central bus station. However, the impressive and elegant facade is obscured from the road by an ugly car park, surmouniby an unattractive medical centre. The hotel is approached via a long winding ramp or some 30 concrete steps - ok if arriving by car, but a bit of a pull if walking especially with luggage.  The room to which we were allocated was on the 5th floor. It had a sloping ceiling which intruded into the available space, and proved to be uncomfortably hot - even with two windows open and a cooling fan running all night. However, after our first night, the…",4
"Booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews. We weren't disappointed.  We met two other couples who all enjoyed the hotel.  The rooms are spacious, beds comfortable and the bathrooms are huge with a walk in shower as well as comfortable bath.  Toiletries are in keeping with a spa hotel. The spa area is a must - very clean and relaxing.",5
Fantastic hotel. The staff are excellent . Great breakfast. Room service very good and quick. We have stayed at other hotels on the Island but now only stay at de France because we think it is the best hotel on the island,5
"Our room was lovely as we stayed in a spa room, but when we booked we asked for a large superking  bed, and were not told there are only 5ft beds in spa rooms. Our meat was tough in our first meal in the garden restaurant the first night, so we didn't eat there again. Breakfast bacon was overcooked, scrambled eggs undercooked.",3
"This hotel looked so good on the website but the photos hid a huge medical centre plonked right in front of it, which ruined the views. The staff were excellent throughout. Breakfast was plentiful. The spa area was relaxing and free for guests. However, the room we were in was tiny and there was no room to swing a cat. The bathroom needs some towel rails and curtains would soften the room rather than the utilitarian blinds.   We used the shuttle bus to St Helier on a number of occasions. If you're on foot, there is a steep climb from St Saviours Road to the hotel - if you're infirm, walking up on foot is not to be recommended. ",3
"We booked the Hotel de France after reading such good reviews and falling in love with the beautiful pictures.  We stayed here for 7 nights and were a bit underwhelmed by the hotel.  On arrival we walked in to a very grand reception and were greeted warmly by staff. However out room, a standard double was a bit disappointing. It was a 2nd floor corner room so had windows on two sides, but it was a tad on the small side. The bathroom had a bath with shower over it, but it was small and rather dated decor. However it was clean and the shower was very hot and powerful and I had wonderful showers. Space was limited though and it wasn't easy getting out of the shower without slipping due to this (and I am in my 30's with no mobility issues). Simple things, like facecloths or mini…",3
"Stayed Friday to Sunday - 10 minute walk to  marina and centre of St Helier - staff were friendly and helpful and quite decent common areas.  The rooms and corridors around them are somewhat typical of fading seaside hotels or guest houses - narrow corridors, rooms not large, floors a little uneven, cramped wardrobe and old fashioned bathroom and sink area (with little space for wash bag etc.) but there is a nice character to it.  But good hearty breakfast,wide selection of grilled English breakfast,fruit, cheese,yoghurts etc.. Free wifi  (not bad), reasonable TV selection and kettle with tea and coffee etc.  Not the cheapest but reasonable value and the friendly, helpful staff make me recommend this as long as you are not expecting plush luxury or modern minimalism!",4
"Upon checking into this hotel we were initially deflated by the size of the room, we did ask to be moved but there was no availability so we were told, there was no mini bar in the room which is quite unisual. Sleep quality was poor as the beds seemed worn out and extremely soft, I even slept at the other end of bed as it felt like the bed dipped and you rolled in the middle, I have just arrived home today and I'm looking forward to a good sleep in my own bed tonight. The spa was lovely as were the staff who were all curtious and friendly, restaurants were a little on the pricey side but there is plenty of choice in St Helier. The breakfasts were good and plenty of choice. Probably wouldn't stay here again though which is a shame because the spa really is superb, I just feel…",2
"Only stayed for 3 nights, but it was great experience. Clean room, nice bed, quietly  situated. staff very helpfullen friendly, breakfast excellent. Dinning very good. Will recommend and come again. Location in walking distance from town center,little bit of a climb going back. Nice vieuw of the town since hotel is uphill. ",5
"Convenient location, good views, comfortable facilities, excellent breakfast.  Some decoration aspects in the bathroom need updating but not a huge problem.  Top end rate for this standard of accommodation.",4
I am writing to say how very disappointed I was about our recent stay at your hotel. My mother had expressed a desire to stay at the Hotel De France.  It had been an ambition to stay there from the 60s when we visited Jersey as a child.  To facilitate this I booked us an executive suite for 1 night on our recent short trip to Jersey. I admit the room was lovely and clean but when it came to my 80 year old mother (who is somewhat mobility impaired) required to shower it was noted that the bathroom lacked a non-slip mat for the bottom of the bath so as to feel safe when showering.  I also noticed there was no grab rail to assist her to step into the bath safely.    I have stayed at lots of different hotels in the world and would say they all had at least a non-slip mat for the…,2
"Lovely hotel, very relaxing, the staff are helpful. We stayed in one of the suites, plenty of space. Breakfast is good, everything you need. The Spa is great, and not busy at this time of the year. Great relaxing holiday.",5
Very good breakfast.  Lovely spa facilities but our single rooms were very disappointing.  No single rooms available with walk in shower.  It was suggested that I shower in the spa.  Have stayed many times over 50 years but now need a walk in shower.  I think for the price we paid this should have been made available to us.,3
"Nice enough hotel but very small bedroom feels like your in a prison cell with soft furnishings. Checked in at 2pm check in time, went to room and can not believe the size of it.  Paid £450 for three nights and can honestly say I've stayed at better premier inns for less money.  Save your money and book somewhere else this place has over inflated prices for what you get. ",1
Very nice hotel with good facilities. Breakfast was xcellent and room clean couldn't ask for more. Swimming pool and spa facilities very good. Eating in the restaurant is reasonably priced xpecially they'll dy menu.,4
"A repeat visit for us, this was our third stay with Hotel de France over several years. We found a consistent high standard and value for money. Particular credit must go to the Spa, relaxation at its peak. Restaurant Menus most enjoyable. Well Done",5
"The Hotel de France offers luxury stay and Spa facilities only 15 minitues away from the town centre walking. All the staff are super efficient and helpful.  It has in house Restaurants such as: Saffrons Restaurant The Orangery Restaurant Garden View Restaurant Lounge Bar  We ate at the Garden View Restaurant one evening. The meal was delicious. Are whole experience was excellent. I would reccommend a stay a the Hotel de France to anyone wanting that personal touch.  There is FREE wifi throughout the Hotel and grounds,  There is also a FREE shuttle service to Saint Helier town centre at regular intervals up until 5pm every day  Our room was very comfortable and stocked up every day with fresh towels, toiletries and Tea/Coffee facilities.  We were on a Bed & Breakfast basis.…",5
"This hotel is totally outstanding, from the reception staff, the welcome and the service. Fantastic spa with great pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi after which you are ready for breakfast. Breakfast in the Orangery is top class, plenty of choice and fresh. Lunch and dinner in the Garden View restaurant was also very good (try the salt and pepper squid) When we come back to Jersey we will certainly stay here.",5
"A very big hotel with plenty of parking, a warm welcome when I arrived. Room clean and quite big with a balcony. Room clean and tidy and every thing you need. Nice walk in shower and also had a bath. Had room service for breakfast on one occasion, delivered on time with a smile. Had breakfast the next day in the restaurant which was fresh, staff very eager to clear your plates before you had finished eating. I tried to have a meal in the Saffron restaurant but because I didn't book couldn't get a table and thought the staff quite rude in telling me this. Apart from a couple of little hiccups would stay again.",3
"Think twice before booking this hotel. It cannot be seen from the main road on approach as it is high up of f the road and hidden behind a very big medical centre hat sit above a car park. It is a big hotel that is spotless throughout but the staff, whilst helpful and pleasant, all looked unhappy. It has no atmosphere from entering the big reception area and that carries on through our experience. It is a 20 minute walk to town centre so not handy for buses, restaurants, etc.  The ""Orangery"" where breakfast is served is no better than a canteen with a glass roof. The tables are not set with cutlery and tablecloths, you help yourself to cutlery from a wooden box on the table. The Garden Room is the only venue for meals other than Saffrons the highly recommended Indian influenced…",2
We enjoyed a relaxing break here and found it convenient to walk into st Helier. staff very friendly and food good. slightly strange mix of old and new building but not a problem. Very quiet room and grateful for lift as on second floor. Rooms very clean but felt some decor a bit dated and could do with some pictures on walls.,4
Lovely hotel. Not really for the younger person as most guests were over 50 I'd say. Spa and pool are wonderful. Decor is a little 'old fashioned' but well maintained and very clean. The staff were extremely helpful and very understanding as we had to cut our visit short due to a family emergency. ,5
Breakfast queues around 9:0 to get into the breakfast room. Staff in the Saffron bar were sullen and not welcoming. Bathrooms need refurbishment and the staff gave you the impression they were not happy in their jobs. Spa and pool were good.,3
"Visited this luxury hotel with friends and had a 'snack' meal in the restaurant. Staff fairly attentive and after struggling to open the fist of three bottles of wine,  we ordered some food. The chicken wrapped in bacon was to be fair quite nice and looked ok. Not my own meal but I was told it was quite tasty. My wife had a salmon fishcake mix. Asked for a main course size with fries and salad. Just one cake, same as a starter size arrived  which was dry and tasteless. The salad had no dressing on it and was limp and un appetising . I had the house burger and as a four star hotel was expecting off the scale quality. What a let down.  Yet again, a dry bun with limited dressing of lettuce, tomato and monterrey jack cheese.

"A very comfortable place to stsy in Jersey within walking distance of St Helier, with nice single rooms...the breakfast food was delicious and so was the restaurant I ate in but the Ayurdevic centre was hugely overpriced and rather pretentious and I smelled slightly of curry after my first massage session, which was not pleasant.  Lovely swimming pool and a good hairdresser....and pleasant and helpful staff. Would definitely stay again but would not would not utilise the Ayurdevic facilities. ",5
The reservation team were very helpful with our large booking. When we arrived very easy smooth check-in & check-out process. Lovely place with friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely be back again.,5
very good level of everything. Excelent for those who prefer old style and quiet place. Food nobody can complain. Swimming pool with extra service. Close to city center and with bus shuttle every hour.,4
"After looking at the reviews and location and pictures I thought this was an ideal luxury hotel for my trip. The hotel is up a long steep hill behind the ugly health centre and after a long day of walking is definitely a slog. The place really looks the part and is generally pretty nice. The pool area is very good indeed. Breakfast was pretty good with a large choice but as others have pointed out the hot food was mainly just warm, but edible enough.  One thing I will say is every member of staff we speak to was very helpful and polite.  The free minibus to town is a great perk and very welcome, although the walk is downhill and only takes 15 minutes if walking briskly.  Our room was a bit disappointing though. No fridge for a four star is a first for me and not the biggest for…",3
"We  booked a spa room for a week. We had a second floor room with great views out over St Helier. Room was very clean & bright, with patio doors into a balcony. Bathroom is of a good size with a walk in shower. Reception staff were generally pleasant & helpful. Apart from breakfast, we didn't eat in the hotel. Saffrons is very expensive. The lounge bar is situated beside Saffrons & can be very chilly because of air conditioning. Piped music was Asian in lounge bar too, which isn't to everyone's taste. Pool area is lovely with a good sized swimming pool. Spa treatments in Ayush are very, very expensive, around £45 for a 25 minute massage seems excessive to me. I would have liked to make use of their treatments, but at those prices I decided against it. In general the hotel is…",3
"The hotel represents excellent accommodation with all the facilities that you would expect in such a hotel ie spa, alternative restaurants etc.  The only slight downside was the high cost for use of the spa and one of the restaurants.  Otherwise an excellent hotel.",4
"We had a four day break at this hotel we were welcomed by Nicolae he was brilliant such good customer service skills and was informative about everything he went out of his way to make us feel welcome and our room was lovely 316 we had told them it was our wedding anniversary and so they gave us such a lovely room with fruit and Prosseco what a lovely touch. Breakfasts were excellent so much choice so we do not understand why people were moaning on trip adviser .The garden view restaurant was good we had a couple of meals there .Also the hotel is spotless we saw one of the housekeepers who does long hours was cleaning the brass fitments on the doors they work hard our room was always spotless the beds are really comfortable and pillows, our towels were changed every day.

"Our stay started badly with the ugly facade in front of the hotel (a concrete medical centre) which obstructs the hotel completely. It looks as though the hotel sold off some of its land for this - what a shame as the hotel exterior would be beautiful if not obstructed. Our room was adequate, clean and tidy if a bit on the small side. We were too hot during the whole of our stay, and even opening the window and putting the provided fan on did not help. We had a rear view - not much to see.  The breakfast was very average, felt like it was designed for bulk flow through. Just a few ""extras"" such as omelettes were available and this was an additional cost. The overall feel of this hotel is of a place that is on the decline.  Apart from the fantastic health club and spa which are…",3

"My sister and I booked a spa package and stayed over night. The spa was lovely and relaxing and the service was great. The atmosphere was very cosy and almost like being abroad (which for some may be the case but we are from the UK!). We got there early to use the gym and after our treatment we had a delicious lunch in the restaurant (you can stay in your spa wear). After a relaxing afternoon in the sauna, pool and steam room we went back to the room for coffee and biscuits. In the evening we got a 3 course meal included in the deal and it was delicious. Staff were very friendly. The breakfast the next day was also delicious. Overall a great visit and highly recommended. ",5
Excellent Hotel. Great facilities including Leisure centre with pool. First rate staff and high standard of cleanliness. Lovely grounds. Large spacious patios. Gardens are very attractive and maintained in a pristine condition.,5
We have stayed at Hotel de France a few times because it ticks all the boxes Friendly staff Great Spa Spacious rooms Great breakfast  The rooms are getting a little dated compared to some hotels but the size is bigger so you can forgive that. Can't wait til next time...,5
The Hotel de France is a very impressive building that overlooks St Helier. Check-in was handled efficiently by polite staff. There was a bottle of chilled Prosecco waiting for us with fresh cut flowers and a large portion of fresh fruit. (The hotel had been informed that our visit coincided with our wedding anniversary so we don’t know whether the wine and fruit were ‘extras’ or standard.)  We had upgraded to a room with a balcony – enough room for the two of us to sit out and take in the view over the town to the waterfront. Our room and bathroom were spacious and very clean. Storage for clothes was adequate but strangely there were no hooks on which to hang our coats – just a single hook on the bathroom door for bathrobes. There was a small heated towel rail but no good place…,4
"This is quite an odd hotel - partly very luxurious with a superb spa/ pool complex and lovely gardens to sit in, but with pretty standard rooms and breakfast room.  Our room was a decent size and very clean/ in good condition but was very warm and had no air conditioning, which made sleeping tricky in hot weather.  The staff were friendly and efficient and looked after us very well.  Location-wise the hotel is a bit out of the centre of St Helier, but not so far out as to making walking in unduly difficult.  Breakfast was generous in portions and decent in variety.  Overall, a decent place to stay in St Helier but really particularly good value if you want to use the spa/ pool.",4
"Stayed here for a week in room 120. What a great hotel, room was a little small compared to modern hotels but was wonderfully clean with excellent bedding, robes and toiletries and a great city view with the sea just visible in the distance. Breakfast was especially good with a wide selection of both continental and traditional choices. I especially liked the small individual jars of HP and tomato ketchup. We ate in the Garden restaurant on our first evening and had a very enjoyable meal which I would recommend, we also ate in Saffrons one evening (please see separate review). Every member of staff we encountered could not have been more helpful, especially those who staffed the reception desk. The hotel is a short 15/20 min walk into the center of St Helier. The hotel…",5
"Stayed here for our 30th wedding  anniversary and was not disappointed. Hotel is lovely and very impressive inside and out. After checking in we were shown to our spa room with balcony and was amazed how spacious and airy it was, well appointed bathroom with separate shower with nice toiletries too and spotless. Lovely views over St Hellier. As it was our anniversary the hotel had put a bottle of prossecco chilling, fruit and a vase of flowers , very nice touch. Well stocked mini bar and plenty of tea, coffee, hot chocolate. Ate at Saffrons and so glad we did as the meal was amazing , we did the taster meal with wine flight and was not disappointed. And don't think you wont be full after this meal we certainly were, the pigeon was delicious and the fillet beef melted in your…",5
"We were disappointed with our stay in this hotel, as it didn't quite hit the standard we would expect from a 4 star hotel. It was quite a walk away from the town centre and was hidden round the back of a medical centre. Breakfast was average with no special features. The room was clean but small. The decor is dated and worn in places. The only exciting feature was the pool/spa area - this was a nice spot to relax in.",3
Amazing hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast had so much choice. Restaurant was lovely ate there a couple of times and couldn't fault at all. Spa area was clean and tidy . Overall could not fault our stay.,5
Lovely hotel for a stay in Jersey.Looks Great from the outside and even better inside.Lovely varied choice of breakfast.Good location within 10 of town Centre.Staff were polite and friendly.Pool and spa areas very clean and ideal when the weather was poor,5
The hotel spa and gym was modern and obviously well used by local people  The rest of the hotel was very dated and stale huge cavernous empty function rooms and long corridors. The bedroom hot and stuffy plastic mattress covers and little daylight it would make an ideal nursing home. The breakfast room placed at the back of the hotel was like a canteen with formica tables and wooden cutlery holders. Complained every day for a week about the temperature. of the food - not a lover of luke warm scrambled eggs and dried up bacon. Staff seemed disinterested and miserable apart from those on the reception desk. The hotel was set behind a health centre in an urban setting quite a treck on foot into town centre we were glad to leave. I cannot understand how it gets a high star rating,1
Staff friendly and very helpful rooms very clean and a good size We had three rooms booked as it was a family meeting on tHe Island and a 80th Birthdat to celebrate . We would certainly come again and recommend to our friends and family,4
"Classic imposing hotel on the outskirt of St Hellier. There is a car park but the parking bays are small. Check-in was efficient. The hotel room was small and clean, with a view of a roof. Everything worked, however the duvet was winter weight, not pleasant in the summer months, I suppose I could have switched on the AC and chilled the room! The room was next to the stairwell and was noisy. Buffet breakfast was OK, but the staff were apathetic. The bar was quiet, and again the staff displayed a healthy couldn’t care less attitude. The dark beer was chilled and even served in a chilled glass; someone needs to explain to the hotel how dark beer and ales should be stored and served, this is totally unacceptable given the prices charged. The spa area is the crowning glory of this…",4
"My girlfriend surprised me with a overnight stay here for my birthday. The building itself has an interesting history and it something to admire in its own right. We ate dinner out on the terrace which was lovely and even involved a bit of live singing. Both our main were delicious. We stayed in a basic room but this was nice, comfortable, and spacious but perhaps could do with modernising? Didn't detract from the experience for me anyhow but I could see some people feeling the furniture in the rooms wasn't as grand as the hotel? Who knows? We got up early and want to Ayush spa which was delightful. The spa is very spacious and has a few different facilities to treat yourself too along with treatments etc. Personally, I'd say it's one of the best in the island and something in…",5
"I traveled with my 96 year old Gran to Jersey to see the Battle of the Flowers, staying at Hotel de France. The hotel was very nice an the staff very accommodating, Sonny who too my booking even checked everything was to our liking one day as we waited for the courtesy bus to town.  I did get to use the spa late one evening, it was very quiet but lovely -shame I didn't get to go again!  Breakfast  an the Garden restaurant were very good. My gran was in a wheelchair an we had no issues getting about either in our room or throughout the hotel. The room we had actually had a fold down seat in the walk in shower which was perfect for gran. ",5
"We came here as a couple for a short break and it's the best holiday we've had! The hotel is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting a spa room, the room was the best hotel room we've ever had, really big, really nice and clean and the bathroom and balcony was amazing! The other part of the hotel is more traditional so I guess that's why some people think it's outdated but our spa room was very modern, couldn't fault it. It was our first time ever to Jersey and we absolutely loved it! (Except the flight which was delayed 5 hours from Manchester, do not fly with Flybe go with easyJet from Liverpool!) but when we finally arrived at the hotel 5 hours late the staff were so friendly and made us feel so welcome! We aren't a big fan of Indian food (but we were told a few…",5
"Lovely hotel which could be excellent with a few tweaks.  Nice sun terrace, good food.  Room spotless although dated.  Very good staff.  Would have been nice if there had been a comfortable lounge to sit inside in the day time for a coffee/tea.  The only place for drink and food throughout the day is the Garden View Restaurant which is more like a café than a restaurant, however the food was very nice.  Would have been nice to have a more formal restaurant for evening dining, not everyone is a fan of spicy food as served in the other restaurant in the hotel.  It's a shame they don't use the breakfast restaurant in the evenings for a formal dining room.   Also access to toilets is a very strange set up as they are upstairs from the main facilities, not ideal when you are eating…",4
We had previously had an very happy stay at Hotel de France about 6 years ago and it was so good to go back. We had a teenage grandaughter with us so we needed a separate room but we had a suite which was cheaper and more convenient.  From the moment we were greeted on arrival it was an excellent experience so much better value than the the faceless big names. ,5
"The hotel was not as grand as I had hoped - the reception staff were variable ( staff on departure were excellent) but not so on arrival Cooked breakfast was poor - lacking in flavour, dry cool bacon, rubber eggs  Saffron restaurant was totally excellent - food and service extremely good -would recommend ",3
Breakfast were very good. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The shuttle down to St Helier was a bonus as it a 15 minutes walk into town. The swimming pool and spa experience was excellent. There are two restaurants in the hotel. The informal brasserie is good but was small for the size of the hotel which means you cannot always get a table and we couldn't sit outside because it was cold even though it was August. The other is based on Indian food which isn't to my liking and was very expensive.  Good hotel for couples. ,4
This hotel is a credit to its management and staff who work hard to provide a wonderful stay.  We cant wait to get back.  The spa rooms are large and we loved the walk in showers.  This hotel is much better that many higher grade rated ones.  We love it.,5
"Stayed two nights in single room at rear of hotel. I was visiting my family so did not have any meals other than breakfast which I had room service. Thought the price was good and all staff very helpful and polite. Would stay again, spa and swimming facilities excellent.",4
"Lovely short visit back to Jersey. Second time at this hotel. Not disappointed,hotel great and spa facilities amazing. Pool , steam room and jacuzzi virtually all to myself in the mornings. Fantastic selection available for breakfast. Will definitely be back for third visit!",5
"From arrival to departure I felt so at ease , the staff at reception are so helpful in booking a taxi for you to arranging a tour of the island.Not forgetting the staff in your restaurant !! Helpful!!  ",5
"Had a very relaxing 4 nights here.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Food in the terrace restaurant was very well priced and delicious.  Walking into the centre of St Helier was fine, but it's great that the hotel offers a free shuttle bus at various times throughout the day.",4
"great day at the pool and in the spa. room is somewhat dated with decor but a great size. breakfast was not good, loads of choice but not the best quality, eggs were too oily, bacon was rock hard. the overall stay was wonderful and saffrons was delicious. great service great food. ",4
"I've been here for a week on business and was put in the Hotel de France. Friendly and helpful staff, an excellent location for a stroller like me, excellent facilities (I regret not having time to sample anything other than the breakfast this trip, but the reputation of the other restaurants- especially Saffron - has me hoping to come back and try...) and, most importantly, a very comfortable and well-appointed room with a good bed. Thank you again - I hope to visit again in the future. ",5
"My wife and I stayed here the first week of August - I had been there twice before but many years ago. The hotel is in an elevated position overlooking St Helier and the bay and is about 20 minutes walk from the centre. A major part of the hotel has been ""mothballed"" for staff use, but there is a new wing and spa. Our room (a ""Spa"" room) was in the new wing, with a balcony and was very nice with excellent views plenty of room and a lovely bathroom. The only slight downside was a lack of towel rail. Everything was well maintained and cleaned. Dining was a rather odd arrangement - a (very good) breakfast was served in a large conservatory but the room was only used for this. There was a Garden Restaurant open all day, but it was more like a coffee shop with a rather limited menu…",3
Had a lovely meal with friends at the hotel restaurant. Great service from a really helpful team. Lovely food - calamari starter was nice and crisp. Duck main was delicious. Nice Merlot with it. Chicken burger with guacamole was tasty as well.  Lovely eclair to finish.  Just a great evening in fairly grand surroundings. One warning - the loo is a floor up which is a tad unusual. ,5
"We stayed here as three friends looking for a short break. We had booked three separate double rooms and were disappointed on arrival to discover that the rooms weren't very close. However, the reception staff did their best to help and were able to offer much better alternatives the following day. The rooms varied in size and are slightly dated but extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. The hotel offers a shuttle bus into town every two hours or so: when we used this it was full but the driver automatically just did two journeys so no one was left disappointed. The hotel has a spa with steam room, sauna, swimming pool, bubble pool and small side pool. We had problems locating two sunbeds together inside as it was a chilly day but the very helpful pool attendant achieved…",4
Excellent stay for our Honeymoon with a great breakfast. Hotel was in general excellent condition along with well kept grounds. Also a nice SPA to relax/unwind in. We would stop here again. A 20 to 30 minute walk from the centre of St Helier depending on the route taken.,5
"We stayed here in February with a gift voucher from our children and had a wonderful time - this time we booked ourselves as a treat - what a let down, the room was dark and dingy and at the back of the hotel - the view was like looking out at a deserted messy field, we kept the curtains shut so that we didn't have to look at it.  The bathroom was tiny and the doorstop was next to the bath and I stubbed my toe on it twice that was how tight the fit was in the bathroom.  The food - totally disappointed with that too the menu has completely changed in the Garden View Restaurant they have lots of choice on all day menu but dinner menu was very poor - when we previously stayed they had a set menu at dinner and also specials on the board at both lunch and dinner sittings only one…",3
"Stayed at hotel de France for 2 nights in twin room which was spacious compared to other hotels we have stayed in. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom with over bath shower, was clean & spacious. Plenty of toiletries provided. Wifi good, tv reception good.  Plenty of choice at breakfast to satisfy everyone. Ate in restaurant first day, had a late lunch, haddock & chips, burger with salad. Food was delicious. Was unable to book a table in restaurant for our second night so ordered room service. Food again was delicious & delivered quickly.  Made use of the swimming pool & sauna which was very welcome after a day spent walking around. Staff were all polite & friendly. I can say with all honesty that the hotel for us was perfect, peaceful & relaxing. ",5
"Can,'t say to much negative about the hotel, except that the bedroom was quite a bit smaller than I've had beforehand. In other 4 * hotels.  Great breakfast and always hot.  Hotel does BBQ's in good weather with steaks and Lobster options. 5\5 ",5
very good hotel but definitely lack any kind of amenities for children nothing for them to do when they were in the hotel nothing in the gardens so I would not say the hotel was child friendly as we found our boys were quite board at times and when we asked at reception if they had any board games or dominoes the answer was no. would not recommend this hotel for children It is for Adults.What a shame. It would not take much to have some entertainment for children as they seem to have a lot of conference rooms they could use with activities to keep the children happy This was our only complaint ,4
"Our room and bathroom were very comfortable and had all the expected amenities of a 4/5 * hotel,  including fresh flowers, slippers, robes, coffee/tea making facilities, cookies, safety deposit box and nice toiletries. The good size balcony had beautiful views of the city. Great place to sit, relax and sip some wine.   Breakfast was adequate and the Garden Restaurant had good food at reasonable prices.   The swimming pool/spa area was very relaxing.  Definitely enjoyed our stay.",5
"We visited Hotel de France for a short break. The hotel is dated like many in Jersey however we enjoyed the terrace and reasonably priced wine when the weather was nice enough. The staff were great and in particular the lounge bar staff who made excellent cocktails. Breakfast was in a very dated dining room but the selection was good. Full English breakfast was available with additional options also available on request.   The spa, gym and pool facilities were fantastic and a nice addition to the hotel particularly if you can't go out and about when the British weather arrives in Jersey. Having an on site car park is also a good plus particularly as parking in St Helier is limited. The hotel is a 10 / 15 minute walk from the town centre so whilst convenient it is on the outside…",4
"We arrived late, due to flight delay and no taxis, we were both hungry and tired, and the hotel certainly didn't put themselves out for us. We were told we had to ordered room service even though last orders in the restaurant was 10 pm, and we checked in at 10 pm.  We did as we were told and tried to order off the late night menu and after three calls and 45 minutes later we cancelled the order as it arrived so late.   I asked if anything on the menu was gluten free and was told no, I asked if there was anything they could arrange for me and was told I could have some fruit, if not, I would have to go hungry.  I said I would have the soup, then asked if they had GF bread and was told that I should have pre warned the hotel I wanted it.    Even the bar didn't have any crisps or…",3
"Perfect location to stay when you are on the island for business. Good service, room with enough space, good bed, absolute silence. Did not make use of the wellness facilities (spa, pool, gym, Ayurvedha massages), but these seem to be of a high standard. Would love to come back in this hotel.",5
"Lovely room with a balcony (paid extra for it). Staff very friendly and efficient. Breakfast ok (what I call a ""keep fit breakfast"" when one has to get everything yourself including make the toast) but not inspiring. Didn't eat in either of the the two restaurants as we preferred to eat out. About a 15-20 minute walk to to the main shopping area but be prepared for the walk back which requires a climb up a hill to the hotel. Taxi is about £5.70 from Liberation Square taxi rank back to the hotel. Lots of free parking for those who have a car. Free wifi is is very fast and has good coverage.",4
"Currently writing this at 1am as the gentleman snoring in the next room is so loud he might as well be in ours! Beware...walls are thin, so if you don't want to hear bathroom ablutions, singing in the shower and bedroom 'antics' bring ear plugs...good ones!! Functional at best. Our room had all the necessities...a bed, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a desk and a bedside cabinet, but what it didn't have was a soul.  Perfectly acceptable for a business trip, but lacking any kind of holiday destination vibe. Staff are pleasant but uninspiring, other than those in the Garden Restaurant, who actually have an energy about them sadly lacking in all other areas of the hotel. Breakfast is taken in the Orangery Restaurant, a room so large it is reminiscent of a staff canteen and although…",3
"Hotel staff were all very friendly and approachable. Wonderful breakfast and food in the garden restaurant. The spa facilities were amazing. We had a great stay and were sad to leave, thank you very much for a fantastic holiday!",5
This hotel exceeds expectations and staff always welcoming. Spa and pool use is never crowded welcoming children. Breakfast buffet can't be faulted. Garden restaurant great for lunch or evening menu. Saffrons Indian restaurant is a dining opportunity not to be missed - sophisticated use of flavours. ,5
"Fantastic hotel not far from St Helier. Staff pleasant and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Spa facilities were brilliant as were the bar and restaurant areas. Lots of choice at breakfast to suit most tastes, would certainly stay there again.",5
"I stayed as part of business trip but whilst at the hotel it felt like I was on holiday, everything I needed was there including transport to the town, though is a nice walk if you don't mind a stroll. Facilities were fantastic and I will possibly look to book a short break with the family to this hotel",4
"My friend and I had a fantastic time away at the Hotel de France, the room was lovely- tidy, clean and very spacious, the staff couldn't have been more helpful, the breakfasts were fantastic and the spa and gym was the best we've ever visited- and we've been to a few!  We thought the cost of the stay was very reasonable considering how lovely it was.  It wasn't far from the town and the hotel provided a super bus service.  Thank you for a lovely stay 'Hotel de France'!  We would love to come back!",5
"All the staff were helpful and friendly. I would certainly return to the hotel. They helped us return to London Gatwick despite our original flight being cancelled and Reception were able to find alternative flights for my husband and me, then book them.  Thank you. ",5
"Very clever website photos as they won't show that the hotel is old fashion. If you look properly most of review are people who don't travel much. Stay there for 3 nights and was very disappointed with mattress(So important for me) and old fashion room. If you like modern, this is not for you. The photos you see are the Spa rooms and are a lot more expensive, Reception and corridor are dated too, staff are very friendly except the SPA Manager who  was not very nice.  Who ask him  if the grand mum could come a few minutes to  see her 6 yo grand daughter in the pool(without using it) and he refused as she wasn't staying in the hotel!  Great attitude Mister! Good position for town, big carpark. Wifi not working always very well. Breakfast correct and Saffran restaurant very nice,…",2
"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel de France and I must say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Staff are very friendly and helpful, our room was nicely laid out and had everything you needed. We had lunch in the Garden View restaurant on both days which was very good and reasonable. Breakfast was a normal buffet style which had everything you would require including a full English. This hotel is about a 20 minute walk from Liberation Square but does have bus if you don't fancy walking. We did not use the swimming pool or Spa. If you intend on using the spa I would suggest that you book early as my partner tried to book herself in but it was fully booked.",5
lovely hotel. helpful staff. great breakfast. easy walk to sea front. buses really good. bit difficult to walk up to the hotel is your not good on your feet. try the garden restaurant. The spa was enjoyed by my wife who also had 2 treatments.,5
The hotel is always friendly and happy to help.  The young man on the Spa reception is always smiling and I good spirits even though it a part time job portrays a great image and helpful  The breakfast has always been good and the quality of the product is a good standard,4
Very good spa and hotel. Nicely situated in St Helier. Quite a steep walk up to the hotel. Spa is very very good. Breakfast is excellent. Rooms are fine. Reasonably priced. Lovely terraces if weather is good. ,5
"Arrived Sunday morning, not able to check in so went along to look around the hotel - our cases were put into a room until our rooms were ready.  We were able to use the spa facilities if we wanted to but decided to get some food at the garden cafe which was excellent.  Our party consisted of five adults and we booked a twin room, double room and single room. The double rooms were excellent, bright, clean and cheerful.  However the single room was a disappointment- very drab decor and depressing.  Not very big either so next time I  would ask to see the room before staying in it.  Apart from that we all had a very comfortable stay and enjoyed using the spa facilities every day.  It was lovely to be able to walk to and from the spa from the bedroom in the robes provided in our…",5
Lovely hotel a little 15 minute walk out of town the hotel is up some steep steps however free hotel shuttle is very handy. Lovely spa facility & the saffron restaurant was fab. Only downside was service at the outside bar was a little slow considering it was not very busy but overall a lovely hotel ,5
Lovely French chateau looking hotel. Breakfast great with full English included as well as fab French bread and croissants. Dined at the garden restaurant one evening very good value with daily specials . Spa facilities excellent ideal for spending a rainy day. Only small gripe staff with English not first language so a couple of mix ups with food orders.,5
"Cannot rate this hotel highly enough, first class, attention to detail exceptional, beautiful hotel and very professional and helpful staff, rooms very comfortable and clean, lovely pool, lots of choice at self service breakfast, restaurant very reasonably priced, beautiful outside seating areas, 15 mins walk to St Helier but free transport bus from outside hotel operates during the day. Plenty of car parking spaces Perfect ! Would recommend definitely 4* plus status  ",5
"Easy check in. Room very very clean - bathroom basic and dated - no ventilation or window in there though. Bedroom nicely decorated - neutral colours - decent sized tv - double bed very comfortable. No aircon or room climate control but there was a fan in there. Breakfast was good and the staff there were very friendly - the orangery is a shrine to a bygone era with turquoise plastic chairs and tortoise carpet !!  The lounge bar had no atmosphere and smelled strongly of the Indian restaurant saffron which was adjoining so we took our drinks to our room. The spa and gym are absolutely great and make it worth staying at the hotel. Modern bright and so spacious with various pools, steam room, plunge pool, jet pools. Would stay there again as it is so clean but it definitely is…",3
"I stayed for only one night on business. I found this hotel a little old fashioned but otherwise it was very clean and comfortable. The pool area is fantastic, probably the best in Jersey! Decent breakfast was provided and the staff were friendly.",4
The hotel and the staff are absolutely perfect for a business trip base in Jersey. I unfortunately only stay for one night but would love to stay longer. The single rooms are plenty big enough and the beds really comfortable. The two restaurants serve tasty realistically priced menus. I had to leave early so missed breakfast but can only imagine will be as excellent as the rest.,5
"First impressions of Hotel de France is it looks rather bland. Long uninviting hallways,slow lifts,bleak lobby. The rooms are very plain,no curtains - just a wind down blind. Large but not charming in any way. Breakfast is more bland. The Breakfast Room is dreary. No charm whatsoever.No tablecloths on tables. Good array of fruits though. Then there is better. The Terrace Restaurant was good with good variety on the menu. Staff friendly and meal delicious. Then there is better. Great wellness centre. Cold plunge pool,steam room,sauna, massage pool etc. Great oasis to spend a couple of hours.Steam room one of best I have been in.Location is 20 minute walk from town centre or average £8 taxi ride. Overall good hotel,not great,not spectacular.",4
"A great place to relax and enjoy a comfortable and quite luxurious hotel. Can't wait to come again ! Make sure not to miss trying the pool/sauna/hammam. Lovely garden as well. The rooms are very comfortable, the beds as well - all is geared for you to have a restful stay.",5
Lovely stay for a weekend with a group of girlfriends.  The hotel has excellent pool and spa facilities and is in a very convenient location for the centre of St Helier.  The newer spa rooms are wonderful - spacious and with lovely views over St Helier.,5
"We have just spent 2 nights in this beautiful hotel. Check in was quick and efficient. Our room was large, clean, modern and all our toiletries were provided. We had a beautiful view of the sea and town from our room. The outside area is amazing; a beautiful garden and patio area where we enjoyed a glass of wine. The spa was a lovely experience, free for guests. The hotel has very good wifi which is a must for us. We ordered breakfast in bed for a small surcharge and it was well worth it, ample portions cooked to perfection. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and particularly Jersey ... I must say the staff here are some of the nicest, personable I have had the pleasure of encountering. Definitely coming back! Thank you for a lovely weekend ",5
"Peaceful luxurious hotel! Love the pool, gardens and especially eating out on the terrace in the evening! Heavenly! The room was very clean and comfortable, the cleaners do an amazing job. The breakfast is fantastic too, what a wonderful choice. I will definitely be back! ",5
"Lovely facade, nice staff, beautiful pool! but don't follow the postcode as it lead us to a field 20 mins away and had no apology from reception staff. But the breakfast was good with GF bread and nice range of cooked and continental. Our room was small but fine for our needs. Would stay there again.",4
"Very friendly and helpful staff. Ate there for 5 out of 7 nights and enjoyed every meal, especially the two meals in there excellent Saffron's Restaurant. As well as the hotels own shuttle bus, the main bus service stops at the entrance to the hotel very regularly.  The hotel is only a 15 to 20 minute walk from the centre of St. Helier. The leisure facilities were fantastic and housed within a new part of the hotel. The hotel appears to be undergoing a programme of redecorating (no work in progress while we were there), but some parts are starting to get to the point of needing redecorating, while other parts are immaculate. ",5
"We were there for a week with a group of pensioners (!) at the beginning of July. A large hotel but very well appointed, our room on a corner was very large, almost a suite. A good bathroom. Excellent breakfast buffet with wide choice, lovely fresh fruit. My wife enjoyed the spa! The Garden View restaurant is good, we didn't try Saffrans. Staff very friendly and capable. Highly recommended.",5
"My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for a weekend away when we came to watch comedian Henning Wehn last month. We picked the hotel mainly for its location, as it's only a 15minute walk or so to the opera house where the event was being held.  The room we stayed in was fairly basic, but clean and the bathroom was a good size with a bathtub too (always a bonus to have the option of a relaxing bath!). It was a really hot weekend and so we thought we would try the swimming pools. There were the highlight of the hotel; the main pool was filled right to the top with water of the perfect temperature. There was also a massage pool to relax in and a warm pool and an invigorating plunge pool. All so amazing! Would go back for the swimming pools alone. We ate in the relaxed bar as we…",4
"1st class stay with very helpful staff. Made to feel most welcome and ""Glad to se you again"" Everything was spotlessly clean. The spa facilities were relaxing and very beautifully kept. All items in tip top working order.",5
"We had a Spa room, which was massive and had a beautiful bathroom. Only downside was size of bed, since the room was big enough to accommodate a larger one. Also, lovely balcony, but it overlooked the flat roof of the spa below. Not great, but looking beyond we're fabulous views of St Helier rooftops and the sea, and sunsets. Lovely spa area, large pool, and I had a massage which was very relaxing. Food wise, we were a little disappointed with breakfast, which although it appeared varied and huge choices, offered limited fruit, a toaster which either undercooked or burned your bread, and very unappealing hot dishes.   On the plus side, the staff were without exception friendly, welcoming and helpful at all times.  Liberation Square is exactly 1.5 miles to walk, taking about 20…",4
"Its a large hotel but very well run .All the staff are excellent and cheerful. As it was our anniversary we has a surprise bottle of champagne and fruit platter in our room on arrival, which was a very thoughtful . The breakfast was first class, with all the normal continental food and hot choices as well. The coffee was lovely. We had a balcony room which was huge room 202. We tended to eat in the Garden room restaurant ,the choice was a little limited but they did a special every day. It suited us as the walk to the town was a good 25 mins, and we didn't feel like walking back after a meal in the evening. The courtesy mini bus from the hotel was good as well. We did most of the site seeing things on Jersey, all very worth while seeing. A very enjoyable holiday and i would…",5
"Just returned from this hotel after our second visit. The high standards from our Sept 2016 visit continue. Ambience, rooms, food etc all great.  Staff are generally very helpful. We took a Spa Room this time (216) and the balcony overlooking St Helier was very welcome with the hot sunny weather.  Superb bathroom too. The gardens were stunning at this time of year and we chose to stay there and relax in the sunshine which was beneficial, along with a cool off in the amazing Spa.  Just a few small negatives though, (none of which would prevent us from returning). One morning we went to the gardens at 10am to find the gardeners cutting the grass. We were then told it would be another hour before the seats were available.  Perhaps it would have been better to do the grass cutting…",4
"Brilliant from start to finish.The staff were all friendly and helpful, allowing us to store our luggage at the hotel all day before and after check out. The room was spacious and clean with a lovely view. We made full use of the accessibility to the spa facilities that were free to all guests (i.e. pools, steam room, sauna etc) which were amazing! The breakfast was excellent too, with so much to choose from. Overall amazing value for money and I would definitely stay again!",5
The hotel has a great spa and the saffron restaurant was excellent .  The food in the cafe was also very good. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I think the bed and TV in our room could be bigger ,4
"Stayed four nights in June 2017. Excellent hotel. Clean, good service, high standards. Make sure you have the breakfast when booking, has everything.  Great swimming pool and spa. Located slightly north of city, seven pound taxi ride to centre or ferry service.  Hotel runs shuttle three or times a day. highly Recommended.",5
"We originally booked a spa room as we liked the modern look of it but were asked if we would consider a move to a junior suite which we did, the room was one of the new ones and extremely clean with plenty of space and lovely panoramic views. The gardens and outside dining were really nice and the food was delicious, the spa and swimming pool was of very high quality and extremely clean. The only issues we had were with the breakfast; The dining room looked very old fashioned and the quality of the breakfast items, particularly the bacon and sausages did not appear to be suitable for a 4 star hotel, the bacon looked and tasted horrible, there was a nice selection of bread and continental breakfast items but these were not routinely replenished so some items were of available…",4
Everything you need for a comfortable stay in Jersey. Only staying overnight on mini cricket tour. Staff extremely helpful - receptionist printed our boarding cards for outbound flight & went out of their way so that we could watch cricket on Sky Sports whilst waiting for taxi to the airport. All dealings with this hotel reflect a high standard of customer service. Recommended.,5
"Lovely place to visit, beautiful gardens. Great pool, good buffet breakfast, would return again if going back to jersey, mainly older couples few younger ones, good cocktails in the garden, standard bedroom nice and and comfy",5
"Lovely weekend away in Jersey the hotel is beautiful. Stayed in a spa room with balcony lovely view and spacious room, staff was lovely and food was delicious especially afternoon tea! Defiantly reccommend especially the spa! ",5
"Took a 3 night break here recently and thought it was very good. Excellent staff, all seemed to be on top of the game and willing to try their best to assist at all times, and although some parts of the hotel are little dated that is only a minor criticism. We ate once in the Garden Room restaurant and had a very good meal although the menu did not have a great selection of meals to our personal taste, but what we did have we enjoyed very much. The buffet Breakfasts could not have been better Big plus is that there is an excellent Pool and Spa complex with great facilities including a large Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room as well as a good sized pool.  Would stay again if visiting Jersey.",5
"Very good indeed, staff that smile naturally, they're a credit to this hotel. Room very good too, didn't use the air con as I prefer fresh air at night. Didn't get a view, not worried by that though as I was here on business.  I didn't eat dinner here just breakfast which was a good buffet with quality offerings. Not too busy at 08:00 which was good.  Clientele were mostly tourists with a few people on business. I met with two of my staff here and had coffee on the comfy settees in the restaurant area. Cost of a filter coffee was £2.20 per cup which I was pleasantly surprised with, nice coffee too.  Fair size car park although I didn't hire a car as I was only in St. Helier for a few days which is all walkable. Definitely stay here again for pleasure or business.",4
"we stayed here for a few nights, after staying somewhere else on the island. We did have a hire car but used the time in this hotel to visit local attractions. There is a courtesy bus which takes you to the town. The room was comfortable yet small, no views, clean and tidy. The breakfast was a buffet which suited us. I would recommend a larger room with a view.",4
HDF is always a great place to visit especially if you can fit in a trip to the award winning Ayush Spa and the fine dining Indian restaurant Saffrons. The Spa rooms are recommended and offer great views from the balcony  ,5
"We stayed here for four nights in June and had a wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful and perfectly situated. We hired a car and there were plenty of spaces to park in the hotel car park. Parking can be an issue in Jersey. The hotel oozed a relaxed elegance and all the staff we encountered were extremely pleasant and obliging. We were on a b&b basis and the breakfast was faultless with one of the biggest selections I've seen. The rooms were comfortable and clean with everything we needed but quite plain and faceless, same with the bathroom. Spa was incredible!!",5
We have been guests at the hotel for many years and return bi annually for business mixed with pleasure. Very good value for money in most pleasant surroundings. Breakfast experience however is the weak link.,4
The staff were very thoughtful and nothing was a problem. The hotel does not put add a service charge. You tip where you have been treated well.There is a hotel bus that takes you into St Hellier but it is only a short walk. The swimming pool is first class. Breakfast is great. You will enjoy every facet of the hotel.,5
Booked our weekend stay and meal in saffrons 3 months in advance. Told reception and restaurant it was to celebrate. This went totally un noticed! Very disappointed. Maybe should have booked a smaller more caring hotel ,4
"We travelled with our elderly parents celebrating their 56th wedding anniversary. Hotel De France went above and beyond, leaving flowers, fruit and wine in the room. Needless to say this thrilled our parents. They also made sure that they selected a room with a lovely view, central to everything and on level one. The Manager was a gent and Dionne was very helpful with our booking. Thank you for making our stay very enjoyable. ",5
"I stayed for a long weekend, first impressions as you approach is why is there a medical centre there, but the hotel is behind it approached  a steep access road. There is plenty of parking which is free. The hotel is well kept, clean, tidy and the staff helpful and friendly. There is an excellent spa at the hotel which is free to guests, it's well worth trying out or splashing out for a treatment.food is good, breakfast is ok, all the usual stuff you'd expect, there is a great Indian , try the sample menu it is excellent, the other restaurant is very good and a reasonable price. The room I had was on the 5th floor, I thought it was small and cramped, the bed was a small double, for the price I'd expect a better room. That said, the grounds are wonderful and there is nothing…",4
Fantastic welcoming staff. Great spa. Good location. Great food. Good value for money- we did the stay and spa package for one and bed and breakfast for 2 nights. Breakfast was very good. The hotel is old but not stick in the old days. Decor is slightly old fashioned in places but very clean. Friendly atmosphere. Loved every second of our stay. Book it now!,5
"This is an excellent hotel, with friendly staff, comfortable rooms and an excellent spa. The only downside (which is minor) is the location, which is a bit further from St Helier centre or the waterfront than is ideal.",5
"Only got to stay here for the night however it was a lovely hotel, very clean the staff were great and the food in the garden restaurant was lovely . Unfortunately I didn't get to use their spa however I have heard great things about it. Would stay here again. ",5
"What a delightful start to my holiday, a spa day with massage at the Hotel de France. Starting with a swim, steam room and then a delicious green smoothy on the terrace followed by a wonderful relaxing massage and then an excellent lunch on the terrace made this a great mum & daughter day out.",5
"We hat 2 weeks in this hotel. Nice place to stay, friendly people, good, but boring breakfast. Really - 14 days no variety at all. Just two kinds of cheese, no change at the fruit bar. Located uphill - for the evaluation of the location of the hotel good and bad in one.",4
"Strange hotel this, looks good when you enter and the spa is fantastic, but the rooms are small and the restaurant menus are limited. There is no entertainment in the evenings so they can drag if you opt to eat at the hotel. Staff are friendly but not attentive, can take 30 minutes to get served and 4 out 5 times will bring wrong order. No air con just a plug in fan. Would I go again,  probably not.",4
"We went as two couples to celebrate our 45th Wedding Anniversaries and could not have found a better hotel it was beautiful with lovely rooms, very clean and ours was extremely spacious, our friends had a mini suite which again was nicely decorated and of course very clean. the maids worked very hard to keep the hotel spotless, it had  an outstanding reception area with staff that were very helpful , the  receptionist in the pool area which was beautiful gave us lots of information about the Island and without her information we most certainly would have missed The Glass Church and Bonne Nuit Bay, so we would like to thank her, the pool which had a swim pool, a Jacuzzi pool and a plunge pool along with a steam room and a sauna was very clean and had sun beds in front of the…",5
I've had a really lovely stay and look forward to returning.  I loved the swimming pool area especially. Thank you for all your hospitality and for your friendly support so that I have everything I needed.  ,4
"Excellent period hotel within short walking distance to St. Helier. Well furnished, very large with great outdoor  space, friendly staff and good service. Very clean and well kept in all areas. Food excellent and a general ambien of period luxury.  Very nice  place to stay. ",5
Very nice party we did for my daughter first communion the ladie who organised was fantastic Sevletana  the golden room was lovely view and terrace  Food superb and staff was very nice and the hotel was nice and clean  Breakfast was amazing ,5
Absolutely loved our stay - it was for my 50th birthday and it was just wonderful. The staff could not of made you feel better - absolutely A1 standard - superb!  We would definitely recommend this hotel to people visiting Jersey.  ,5
"Second visit in suite 319. A perfectly quiet and private location for a couple. Great views over St Helier. Hotel de France is not ultra modern but that's what we like. It has that old fashioned appeal where staff show respect to clients. Saffrons Restaurant is a treat. Love it. Spa and pool superb. Hotel big and spacious, town location a mile or so from coast. ",5
"I regularly stay at the Hotel and have seen it through a full year cycle. Whatever the time of year, I always find a consistent high quality level of service and accommodation. Summer and the weekends can be a bit noisier but this is due to the guests and their lack of spatial awareness and consideration for others. I have found that the hotel staff will do all they can to make your stay as comfortable as they can. ",5
Hotel overall is very nice but not disability facilities friendly unless you pay to upgrade your room. Lift to the upgraded Spa rooms broke down one evening. The lifts to the older section of the hotel do not go to some of the floors in the spa room section of the hotel and therefore there was no option but to have to climb or descend a flight of stairs. No access at that point for wheel chair bound people!!!,3
"This hotel is a stunning and relaxing place. There are a mixture of ages here but its mostly 35 and up. Not great for young kids infact I have not seen many children in the last week. Top class spa and as all the reviews will say the staff are fantastic. The terrace service is a little slow but its like that all over the island. The food here is 5 star. There is a hill at the entrence that I only walked up once. We always got the free shuttle bus down town and a taxi back. Taxi from the center cost between £6.40 and £8.40. Highly recommend a the Waverly bus tour around the island, they will pick you up at the front door and drop you back. Its a 7hr tour of the coast for £20 a head and the time flys.",5
"The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the spa facilities are very good and the treatments are excellent.  We had a 'spa' room which was very spacious, clean, comfortable and well-equipped.  Breakfast was good and the Garden restaurant offered good value.  Overall, somewhat expensive, but value for money.",4
The hotel is certainly more expensive than others but the quality of it matches the price. Experience was great and had no issues whatsoever - they even provided a free minibus to town every couple or so hours.,5
I have treatments at the spa and they were amazing.  So relaxing I fell asleep.  The location is perfect as we walked into St Helier to do some shopping then walked back before having our spa treatments.,5
"We stayed 5 nights at the Hotel de France and had a wonderful time.  Breakfast was very good with a choice of cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts and cooked breakfast. The Garden resturant served very good food and was reasonably priced.  ",5
Such friendly helpful staff. Complimentary flowers fruit and prosecco to help us celebrate a very special anniversary.  Lovely reasonably priced food and bar. Good spa facilities . Complimentary shuttle bus although only a ten minute downhill walk into the centre. ,5
"Great little break, spa and big new bedrooms are beautiful. Only let down was the breakfast that is average. Lunch was probably a 4/5: 3/5 for fish and chips & 5/5 for salad. No bottled water with kettle. You have to buy it.",4
 We had a great  time cannot wait to return would chose as spa room again. The spa a was excellent as was the pool area. Thoroughly enjoyed my massage. Service and choice in the restaurant was  very good,5
"The hotel is on a hill on the outskirts of St Heller. It has two parts, the original attractive historic building which is decorated very traditionally and the newer spa wing where our room was. Our room was enormous and had a terrific view over the town and with a glimpse of the sea beyond. The only thing which slightly spoilt the view was the concrete roof of the spa. The hotel was spotlessly clean and service was friendly and helpful. We ate several times in the Garden restaurant where the food was reasonably priced and delicious. We didn't try the more expensive Indian restaurant. There is a shuttle bus to the town centre and the regular bus stop is just outside. I didn't have time to try the spa as we were too busy sight seeing. The one way system in St. Helier is very…",5
"We stayed at the hotel for a 3 day break, the room was ok, but small and hot with no air conditioning. On the second day we mentioned this ar reception and by the afternoon we had been moved to a larger air conditioned room. The spa and pool are fantastic, their is an hairdressing salon were I had a wash and blow dry by a very professional French stylist. The food is very good with evening specials and the breakfast is extensive and self service,all in all an excellent hotel.",5
"Amazing stay in the hotel which was only a 20 min walk from the city centre.. very friendly staff, very nice and clean hotel. The room was spacious with a beautiful view, but you need to ask for it. The breakfast was delicious with so much choice. The spa was brilliant! Very clean and good maintained. You can choose between a swimming pool (135 deep), jacuzzi, hot water shallow, steam room, sauna, and plenty of loungers inside and outside the swimming pool area :) will definitely recommend it to others:)",5
"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights as we were visting family who went to work there.  The hotel staff were very helpful, the room had a great view at the front and was very comfortable throught our stay.  They had a great spa which all hotel guests could use and was open until 9pm at night.",4
"We had a standard room which was on the 5th floor. The lift was a necessity. We were greeted very pleasantly and our luggage was stored as we arrived before the book in time. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was self service and the choice was immense. The first two mornings they forgot my husbands coffee but after having a quiet word Florence made sure that he got it without a problem. Fried eggs seemed to be in short supply, though so if you like your cooked breakfast with a fried egg be sure to get there early.",4
"We stayed at the hotel for two night; it was our first visit to Jersey. The hotel was nice. It wasn't decorated to my taste but that is not a complaint / negative. We took a taxi from the airport (avoiding two buses) and it cost £15 (from the airport to hotel) and nearly £20 (from hotel to airport because of traffic; school pick up time). Perhaps avoid return flights at 4.45pm, or leave earlier (we left at 3pm).  The staff were very helpful, and check in/out was simple and pain free.   The town centre is an easy walk, maybe 10 mins. We walked into town every day for a meal. I'll review the restaurants separately. We ate breakfast in the hotel which was part of our booking. The staff were lovely, and friendly. It was your typical continental / hot breakfast but with some …",5
"We visited with friends that have stayed here before. We opted for a spa room which are located in the newly built end of the hotel & as we were on the second floor we had great views over the town & even the sea in the distance. The rooms are very spacious with 2 large windows & a balcony with table & chairs on to sit & relax in the sunshine. The hotel itself is immaculate & the staff are very friendly & amenable to your every need. The breakfast was amazing with so much choice, which is constantly replenished by the staff. The spa is fantastic & loved spending time in there, again very clean, well maintained & friendly staff. Plenty of sun loungers to relax on  Overall our 3 night stay was top notch, can't recommend enough & will defiantly stay here again",5
"Stayed for 4 nights with my elderly mother. We both had spa rooms which were lovely and spacious. The hotel staff were exceptionally polite and helpful and went that extra mile for you. The food in the Garden Restaurant was a very high standard and would recommend this as a good place to eat. Plenty of selection at breakfast from full English to continental including meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, yoghurts, toast marmalade and jams. Only criticism is that as this is buffet style the full breakfast had hard fried eggs as had sat a while on a hot plate and food was only lukewarm. Overall would highly recommend this as a good place to stay - but be warned it's a good 20-30 minute walk into Liberation Square although hotel does run a shuttle service during the day.",5
"we stayed here last week for 3 nights as a family of 4 (2 teenage boys) we had one double and one twin room on the third floor. The views from both our windows were stunning, looking over St Helier and the sea. The beds were the most comfortable we have stayed in any hotel, heating and fans provided in both rooms. plenty of hot water, clean towels daily, couldn't fault the accommodation at all. The hotel is huge. Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice and food was hot. Downside was the staff in the breakfast area are not of the same high standard as the rest of the hotel. No smiling faces and despite not being busy we waited ten minutes at least on all three mornings to be seated as no dedicated member of staff around.....a few guests waited longer. The pool and spa area are…",4
"We would recommend the hotel and spa to anyone. Three days was definitely not long enough and we will return soon. The spa is a must, very clean and well managed. Would also recommend that people try the garden restaurant, very good value for money.",5
The hotel was a 20 minute walk into St Hellier although they do have a curtesy bus that also can take you to the main bus terminal  Amazing staff and food highly recommend Hotel De France nothing was too much trouble ,5
"The facilities and staff are excellent, being a bit out of the town centre is nice but a bit of a walk. The 23 bus drops you at the door so no problem there. The pool and spa are first class. We ate in the hotel on one night and the meal was very good. Our view over St Helier from our 2nd floor room was great, with 3 windows you could lay in bed and watch the town gradually light up",5
"the Hotel de France was the perfect location, close to where I needed to be for work. the staff were excellent, sorting out the little extras such as my boarding pass and organising taxis the big bonus was the Garden Room restaurant that served delicious food until 10pm,no need to go anywhere else.",5
"Our second visit to this hotel,we went back because we enjoyed it so much the first time. Staff are always courteous and friendly. The pools are wonderful and when the weather outside is poor, at least we could enjoy the different pools,sauna and steamroom.  Breakfast is plentiful with lots of choice. The food from the bar is also good. Our room was spacious,with the largest bed we have ever slept in. Everything was spotless, the staff always seemed to be cleaning. Would recommend this hotel highly.",5
"Our balcony room was excellent: large, comfortable with a big bath and walk in shower, and outstanding views.  The hotel's facilities were exceptional: a large indoor swimming pool (with ideal water temperature) and outdoor sunbathing area;  comfortable and attractive outdoor eating area; beautiful garden with areas for sitting out; outstanding and authentic ayurvedic spa; well equipped and large gymnasium; two very different eating places with wide choices of all prices; very generous breakfast; large car park; efficient and friendly staff without exception; only 15 minutes walk from the centre of St Helier, where there are masses of restaurants of all types of cuisine",5
"From arrival to departure this hotel is great. We stayed in a double room, facing the garden, and I would recommend requesting this view. The rooms are a decent size, certainly not huge, but plenty big enough for two people. Very good air conditioning. Beautifully decorated. Good sized bathroom with huge fluffy towels.  We used pretty much all of the facilities the hotel has to offer during our stay.  Very extensive breakfast with every item you could possibly wish for and more.  Saffron Restaurant is excellent. We were both pleasantly surprised and highly impressed with the extremely high quality of the food and service.  The terrace is a great location for drinks at any time of the day.  It is well worthwhile treating yourself to a spa treatment. The experience is tranquil and…",5
"We stayed at the hotel during the late May bank holiday in 2017, when the weather was quite lovely and warm. Unfortunately, we upgraded to a ""Spa Room"" - not entirely why they were called that...The bed, which was ostensibly a UK King, was a double bed, and the air conditioning, which was genuinely required during this spell of warm weather, was insufficient.  I did ask at the desk to have the AC looked at, but did not receive an answer, and there was certainly was no indication that anything had been done...  The breakfast room was also uncomfortably warm, and the bird droppings on the transparent ceiling really should be addressed.  This is not a cheap hotel, and they aspire to 5 star status, but there's no sense pursuing 5 Star Status if guests are not able to be comfortable.",3
"Both the location and room were fine. Staff were very friendly. Breakfast was excellent. Loads of choices of fruit juice, cereals, cooked items and fresh fruits with Greek yogurt. The supervisor, Florence, was really good and even ensured there was hot food available after 10.00 am on a Saturday, after I explained that I would be doing the Parkrun that morning and would probably not arrive back until 10:05.  Did not eat in the Saffrons Restaurant as the prices were very high but the Garden Restaurant was fine - about the same price you would have to pay for mid-range restaurants in St Helier. Enjoyed relaxing in the Lounge Bar after the evening meal. The staff knew how to make a decaffeinated Cappuccino that was strong enough and the hot chocolates were good as well.",4
The hotel staff were very attentive and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The food was excellent. Everything you would want from a hotel and more. Downside would be the limited parking when the fitness centre is open to the public,5
"To celebrate our 30th Anniversary, we treated ourselves to a nice hotel.  The Hotel de France was everything we wanted and more.  The added bonus of a spa made our visit more relaxing.  The staff are very friendly, welcoming and ready with a word of greeting or assistance.  The chefs and waiting staff made nothing of my food intolerances and my needs were met without any fuss.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5
"A great hotel which offers everything you could possibly want.  The reception were superb in answering all of our questions, where to go, and how to get there etc.  The bar staff were very pleasant as too were the staff in the health spa.",5
"My wife and I were having a double celebration my 60th birthday and our 33rd wedding anniversary paid by our eldest son , the hotel is the cleanest ever stayed in we had a spa room balcony view perfect, walk in shower and bath included all spa rooms , bed very comfortable ,decor lovely, free internet ,mini bar fridge , slippers and robes included ,has comfortable tub chair and two seater sofa same style, British t .v channel's including sky sports, if you have any problems walking there is a steep hill from hotel to road ,but don't let that put you off as their is a mini-bus shuttle service each day we stayed Mon-Fri bus leaves 8.30am,10am,12 midday,2pm and last one 5pm all free of charge if you wish to use on return be at liberation bus station at 15mins past each trip as round…",5
"Easy to reach, ample parking, love the spa. Albeit rooms were clean and spacious, they are really in need of modernising :) breakfasts were nice. Walk into the town is 10-15 mins. Room was quite warm in may so expect that this could be a problem mid august.",4
"Stayed for one night only in a single room. Lived up to its reputation. Beautiful large terrace to drink and ea overlooking a well kept lawn in the sunshine. Very wide corridors.. The Saffron restaurant was closed due to it being a bank holiday so we ate in the Garden restaurant. The staff were superb, friendly but very professional. Good wine list and everything you would expect from such a hotel. Most impressed with the entrance lobby, very large and a Mediterranean feel. Being situated outside of the town centre means it is that much more difficult to get into town for those with reduced mobility although taxis are not expensive. The hotel itself is disabled friendly",5
"Elegant surroundings with top class service, a little out of the Town but easily walk-able and there is a bus stop close by.  Our room was of a good size and very clean.  We eat in Saffrons Restaurant, this is food to die for, beautifully cooked and very cleverly spiced to enhance the flavours.  Service was excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble for the Front Desk staff. Breakfast was very good with plenty of nicely cooked items.  Whilst we did not make use of the Spa & Gym it is an impressive set-up. All in all a fabulous stay, I highly recommend this Hotel and we would love to stay there again.",5
"Stayed here on business, and can't fault the accommodation or gym. Good spacious room, a gym and pool that is really top spec. However it was all knocked down a peg or two by the food in the Garden View Restaurant. When a place raves about food provenance and local sourcing on the intro to its menu you expect it to do just that. However there were no Jersey Royal potatoes even though it was height of the season, no local fish despite being in the middle of the English Channel and the 'brioche bun' that came with my chicken burger wasn't, it was a soft white roll despite what the chef says. It was a real shame, and really tarnished what is, in every other way, a lovely hotel.",3
"Stayed in Jersey for a quick two nights. The Hotel is very large, noticeably clean and the room was comfortable, no complaints there at all. Much has been described before, the spa is one of the best I've seen and we didn't get to spend enough time in there.  4 stars though because it's no better than other hotels where I've paid less and being told my 9pm booking for dinner for two was 'too late' for the restaurant (which takes last orders at 10pm) kinda messed up my plans. The eventual dinner at 8:30 was ok at best but nothing to rave about. Also the after hours room service menu is designed for you to order take out rather than eat any of it. But the breakfast is very nice and we had a good stay.",4
"Firstly, the room was excellent, spacious, modern and quiet. I am not sure if the small balconies should influence a decision to stay in this type of room as the view isn't anything special and give a clear view into the neighbouring room. This meant being a little more careful having blinds lowered when getting ready etc but overall a very nice room.  The initial feeling when you enter reception is that the hotel is a little dated, not in a jaded way as everything is very clean and well decorated but we did wonder if other rooms were of a similar standard to the spa suites.  The staff are very friendly and helpful even printing off our return boarding passes which was useful.  The two points which stop it being excellent are:  a) Although the breakfast is very good and had…",4
"Have used this hotel every year for over 30 years. Location good for town centre attractions including buses, restaurants etc. Car parking for residents. Personally have not used sports/spa facilities but they seem popular. Staff friendly and efficient.",4
"Hotel de France is a wonderful hotel with friendly helpful staff.  It offers many Spa treatments and has a great pool etc.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and provide all facilities required for your stay.  Breakfast is amazing, providing varied food from cereals, cold meats to a wide range of hot food as well as catering for requests, such as omelettes.  The location is also good, being on the outskirts of the the town but still walkable.  There is a regular bus service outside the hotel.",5
"We thought were put in staff quarters; the room was basic, I've stayed in better premier inn hotels. The staff in the bar were unfriendly.  The spa staff and facilities were very good but we felt very let down on the rest of the experience. ",2
"Stayed at this hotel as a child with my dear Father some 45 years ago  Many memories came flooding back, the hotel although now larger has not lost its charm and class.  The staff were very helpful, food was good. I will return soon  ",5
"The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of the town. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The spa facilities and restaurants are of a high standard. I would visit here again for a short break of longer. ",5
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. All the facilities were superb. Staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. Food was lovely in the garden view restaurant. My only complaint would be no gluten free bread was available only rolls which were okay but my mum would've preferred bread for her toast at breakfast time. Overall excellent hotel,5
"Another excellent stay and time at the Hotel De France .Friendly and helpful staff. Very good breakfasts, clean and comfortable rooms, superb spa and gym areas. Well positioned, easy access to St Helier. Highly recommended.",5
"Return trip to Hotel de France 50 years after our honeymoon. Almost everything had improved beyond recognition - rooms, facilities, food, etc., etc. This time we were allocated an excellent room with view over St. Helier to the sea, castle, bays and (distantly) France. Just below our window was the beautiful terrace and garden area. But also, unfortunately, a huge and  ugly brown rectangle - the roof of something called the Lido health centre, which seemed to have been built on what had been garden and parking 50 years ago. To the left was what looks like a derelict-factory wall, but is actually part of the ugliest hotel garage we've ever seen.   Those niggles apart, everything was very pleasant and satisfactory. The staff were uniformly helpful and efficient, our room was…",4
we were there for a Family Party Martin Cullen 60th it was brilliant and we will certainly stay again. and we really liked the swimming pool and breakfast was really good and reception was most helpful,5
Very impressed with the hotel - staff and amenities were above expectation. Good value for money. Dinner in the hotel was very good. Breakfast service was disorganized and not as good quality as we anticipated considering how good dinner was.,4
"Around a 20 minute walk from Liberation Square, the De France is a great hotel for visiting St Helier. Staff here are friendly, polite and happy to help; nothing is too much trouble. Good size rooms with hospitality tray, hair dryer, safe and TV. Bathroom has over bath shower which is quite adequate. Excellent choices at breakfast time, with something for everyone, from cold buffet and pastries to a full English. Plenty of fresh tea and coffee and fruit juices available.  The hotel has a couple of fabulous restaurants; the informal Garden Restaurant and the more formal Saffron Restaurant. Both offer the most delicious food and wines at reasonable prices. The hotel also has a spa and pool, however I can't comment on them as I didn't use them. My friend and I were in room 506…",4
"The Hotel de France offers excellent facilities for those visiting Jersey. The hotel is located on the North East side of town so it is easy to get to Gorey and the North, as well as being well-positioned to walk into St Helier.  The reception area is large, so it is easy to put your luggage down without feeling that you are in the way of other guests when checking-in. In the three times I have stayed at the hotel I haven’t experienced problems in finding somewhere to park.  We stayed in a Spa room and would recommend an upgrade to one of these rooms, even with the extra cost.  The bedrooms are large, with ample storage space; one floor to ceiling window and one opening door onto a small balcony provide plenty of light as well as views over St Helier and the sea. The bathrooms…",5
"Just returned from a 5 day break and had a brilliant time.  Weather was mixed by the hotel was great.  From walking in the door to reception to checking out the staff could not be more helpful.  The rooms were immaculate and the service in the various restaurants and bars was also very quick and efficient.  Had a room on the 4th floor, it wasn't large but it was adequate for the length of visit and the en-suite was in good order.  Stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and ate several meals in the hotel, including an afternoon tea which was delicious and very reasonably priced. The free wi-fi was excellent.",4
"I was having my own home decorated so thought I would treat myself to a week stay at Hotel De France..I would make the same choice again in a heartbeat..I had a wonderful stay. I was surprised at how quiet this spacious Hotel was and naturally I took full advantage of the Spa facilities.I returned to my home , relaxed and feeling as though I had been away on a real holiday. !!!",5
Stayed for two nights and it must be said that the common areas are exceptional. Room was somewhat disappointing for such a hotel. Breakfast was very good and consistent - one of the best that we have experienced in the UK. Excellent service.  The Saffrons restaurant in the hotel is a real fine dining experience albeit quite expensive. The Garden View restaurant in contrast is an excellent mid market experience at reasonable prices.  Overall recommended but there is room for improvement in the room offerings.,4
"This hotel is so tired and dated, we had booked an executive suite and I don't think it had been refurbished since the 1980's, faded and dated furniture. Standard double bed and poor quality bed linens. We didn't stay and moved to another hotel, cheaper per night and far superior. The location is poor, tucked behind a medical centre and the reception area is so vast with so many leather sofas it looks like a furniture shop. The staff were pleasant but this hotel is not keeping up with competition.",1
"So glad we chose this hotel for our short weekend to Jersey. The hotel is very big, how ever the way it's run is superb, from front desk to restaurant staff. Breakfast was exceptional, everything you could ask for to set you up for the day. We did eat in the Garden View restaurant which was good, except I had to change my cheesecake dessert, which tasted of nothing was very dry (rubbery) and old. This was changed and the lemon tart was better. We are planning another visit and would not hesitate to book here again. There is a but stop right outside and it's about a 20 minute walk to Liberty bus station.",5
"Beautiful hotel with excellent facilities. We had a spa room which was amazing. Large bathroom with a walk in shower and bath. Bath robes and slippers provided. Great views over St Hellier. The spa facilities in the hotel were superb. The buffet breakfast had a great election of pastries, cereals, cold meets and cheeses, fresh fruit and cooked breakfast. You could order omelettes and kippers etc off the breakfast menu.   We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel",5
"What more can I say, all the staff are brilliant, and the food at the garden view restaurant and at breakfast was amazing. We are never disappointed and always look forward to our next visit. The only slightly negative comment I would make is about the price. It is getting more and more expensive to stay here every year, but to be fair so is nearly everywhere else in Jersey. We will continue to visit as long as we can as it is a beautiful island.",5
"Excellent facilities but breakfast was a real let down. Dirty cups, over cooked a dry black pudding, tasteless sausages, under cooked bacon and sloppy mess that was supposed to be scrambled eggs, very poor ",3
"Lovely little staycation with my daughter...Very relaxing , comfortable and clean. Friendly and helpful staff and a brilliant spa . Great location view lovely views ... food is good . Definitely will be staying here again ",5
I stay on average 3 or 4 times a year for 7 days. NEVER had an issue with the hotel or the staff. Great place to stay and very much enjoy my time at the hotel. Staff are always ready to help and even after a hard day they have a smile for you :-),5
I reviewed this hotel last year and it is no different this year except we had an even better room with a balcony this time. Friendly staff everywhere in the hotel. The food is lovely. The spa is just perfect. Will go back again and again . I can honestly say I have never been anywhere so friendly and polite. Nothing is too much trouble. ,5
"The Hotel de France offers good value for money with an excellent Spa and very high standard breakfast. The staff are knowledgeable and keen to make your stay perfect, going that extra mile to ensure that you are looked after. Close to St Helier (short walk) and offering car parking. ",5
Overall this Hotel has most things you would need from spa to quality restaurant . I have used this hotel many times although it is not in the town centre that is not a bad thing especially in the summer when St.Helier is very busy at night. Has shuttle bus into town. Highly Recommended,5
"Really enjoyed my stay. My room was clean, bedding crisp, room nicely finished each day. Pool facilities are great. Staff polite, welcoming & friendly. Buffet breakfast not the best I've had but perfectly good. Would definitely book there again.",4
"Conveniently located and a short walk into town , we had a car but chose to walk ( if you do drive be sure to get prepaid parking tickets , everywhere sells them and very reasonable)  The breakfast has a good selection to cater for all , staff are friendly and attentive The Spa is outstanding, and I strongly recommend the Hot stone massage by Shree , she was amazing and the best I have ever had!  Beautiful island will definitely be returning ",5
"The room was a good size and had a very comfortable bed. The hotel itself is spacious and very quiet. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a parcel that needed to be couriered to the UK and reception dealt with it without a fuss. Breakfast was excellent, and the spa and treatments were lovely. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the centre of St.Helier but this was not a problem for us, and there are plenty of taxis.",5
"This hotel,in my opinion is one of the Best in Jersey! SO friendly Great service Amazing food in the Restaurant,beautiful spa facility lovely large comfortable rooms Staff can't do enough for you the food is Very Reasonably priced,Very close to St Helier an Amazing choice of breakfast just an All round ""Awesome"" Hotel!",5
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed a four night stay here. Hotel is faultless and the pool and spa area are superb. Had one delicious meal in the hotel restaurant and breakfasts were very good. Staff all friendly and helpful. Would love to come back here. ,5
Everything about the hotel was 1st class the only gripe we have is that  we could not get a pack of cards from the shop and wanted a deposit of £5 to borrow a set from reception/seemed excessive and would have expected there would have been some made available along with board games without a charge since there is no enyertainment laid on.!!!.  ,5
"That was my first stay at Hotel de France. While the hotel looks nice on pictures, reality is a dit different. First, the entrance in the property goes through a medical center, which is a bit weird. The rooms are large and clean, but dated and poorly designed. Expect to walk along very long corridors and take super slow elevators to get from one area to another of the hotel. The location is a bit far away from everything, so you will likely need a car or a taxi. The breakfast buffet was definitely not very tempting, particularly on the warm side, so I ended up by eating bread and cheese (which, to be fair, were good). I di dnot try the spa or the restaurant, but heard good comments about them.",3
Everything about this hotel is wonderful even all the stairs you walk up from the street. Burns off some of the calories you eat highly recommended fab hotel about 5 minutes  walk from town. The staff are amazing the grounds are beautiful the spa is superb the gym is very high tech (I prefer old style irons) I honestly can not say anything bad about this hotel at all.,5
"On the surface the hotel looks great but scrape off the lamb sauce and the mutton appears. Lovely reception area with friendly helpful staff. A very clean room with a  good view of the beautifully manicured garden, and a nice view over the roof tops towards St. Aubin's Bay. The room (412) would be fine for a night or two, but we were booked for a week. It was claustrophobic, no air conditioning and the carpet, like myself had seen too many shampoos. There are two restaurants in the hotel. The fine dining Saffron restaurant and the more casual Garden View restaurant. We tried the Saffron first. My wife asked if she could have a plain fillet mignon. Not possible, all the meat had been marinated in spice and there was no non-marinated steak in the kitchen. We were advised that the…",3
"Booked a stay over Easter Weekend. Hotel told us we'd qualified for a repeat customer discount which we'd not cited, but had applied it for us already. Feather free pillows requested already there when we arrived. Very clean adjoining single rooms (husband snores!) and excellent service throughout our stay. Enjoyable, restful weekend - thank you!",5
"What a fantastic hotel! We had a 4 day stay and could not have returned more rested and relaxed. Staff were superb, food was delicious and the spa was simply perfect. Will certainly return to his fantastic hotel.",5
"Large, professionally run, efficient hotel, but friendly and pleasant. Food and drink venues and provision are good and rooms comfortable, clean and well-appointed. Nothing to dislike and much to feel pleased with.",5
Very clean and lovely room staff at reseption could have been a bit friendlier but breakfast staff in dinning room couldnt have been more helpful. Bed very comfy and very clean room towels where changed daily.     Smelt nicce and clean always. The only thing let it down was reseption staff rude and abrupt and didnt bother to even look up from what they where doing when talking to you a bit rude in anyones book. ,4
"Stayed for 2 nights with my husband in room 256. Emailed hotel before arrival to request a high floor front facing room, and this is what we were given. Hotel looks lovely and very grand when you pull up (taxi from airport about £20). Check in was smooth, our room was very large and well presented, bathroom was incredibly clean but slightly dated, shower was powerful. Our room had 3 windows all with blinds but no curtains, would have looked nicer with some drapes. Bed and pillows were clean and comfortable. Few minor moans, robes were provided but not slippers so we had to walk down to the spa barefoot, faded gold tap and shower fittings in bathroom spoiled the look a bit, our bed was against the wall of the room next doors wardrobe and drawers so we could hear them banging and…",4
"Large imposing hotel that is located overlooking St Helier.  Plenty of free parking, excellent pool area (with hot and cold tubs, sauna etc).  It is a comfortable 15min walk into St Helier (but note it is uphill on the way back!).   Our room on the first floor had two large windows giving a view over the town and some great sunsets. Great breakfast in Orangery each morning - full selection available (although muesli was in packets and very limited choice of dried fruit and seeds/nuts - but otherwise fine). See separate review of brasserie (which didn't impress as much)",5
"Stayed in Jersey in March with the family. Hotel was excellent, very clean and all the staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast offered everything you could ask for on the buffet and if you required something cooked specially they were happy to oblige. We took full advantage of the Spa & Pool and it was lovely, very relaxing. A very nice stay for our first trip to Jersey.",5
"Short trip Easter weekend with my husband and son and daughter in law. Hotel was a delight. very grand , reception staff really friendly and helpful. Rooms and communal areas spotlessly clean . Beautiful grounds and fabulous breakfast. Buffet style including full English but there is a menu on the table for poached eggs , kippers etc which are all made to order for no extra charge. Beautiful relaxing spa which even if you aren't having treatments is still worth a visit. Not far out of town (15 mins walk) and lovely and peaceful for a great nights sleep. Air con in the rooms for the summer months. I'm already planning another trip back later in the year.",5
Really good hotel. Clean and in good decorative order throughout. Excellent service from all staff. We have stayed at this hotel number of times and the standard never slips. The restaurants have good menu with friendly attentive service.,5
"Booked a standard double, the bed was very comfortable, the room was quiet. Felt the room and bathroom was in need of a spruce up with regards décor to bring it in line with the rest of the hotel, which is very well presented. The staff were very helpful and polite, we ate in the Saffron restaurant, which although expensive was top notch food and an eating experience in the tasting menu. We should have perhaps pushed the boat out a bit more and gone for a junior suite that I would expect would be a better furnished room. Over all a very pleasant trip.",4
Hotel de France is a great hotel. The rooms are lovely. There is an   amazing choice at breakfast. The staff are nice and friendly. The pool is great and so is the spa. It is also a perfect venue for a wedding reception. ,5
The hotel is well equipped with excellent spa and pool facilities.   Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were cleaned and very sufficient.  Bathroom needed minor attention. Tiles were cracked on floor and shower head was not a good as it could have been.  Food was excellent and good choice of bars and restaurant options.,5
"I stayed here through business for 3 nights. I booked a single room off season and this offered relatively reasonable rates (for Jersey) so I thought that I would give it a go.   The room did in fact contain a single bed (didn't realise that these rooms actually existed any more) and was very small and unconventional in shape. It was appointed in a modern and relatively good quality fashion. The bathroom was clean.   I had breakfast at the hotel each morning and this was okay. On one morning it tried the smoked haddock and poached egg option that was disappointing.  The fish was obviously frozen and then poached that resulted in something that was extremely dry and tough. To be fair, the poached eggs were cooked very well.   Even though the hotel is situated in St Hellier it is…",3
"This hotel already has a trip advisor 5 star rating and I can understand why,I could not fault anything.Its a grand looking hotel within walking distance to St Hellier( or shuttle bus). The staff in all departments friendly and attentive.The rooms clean,fresh and completely adequate.The swimming pool,gym and spa very lush. We ate in one of the restaurants and the food was delicious and enough also not over priced. It was quite a quiet time when we went so could not comment if it was the height of season. A lovely weekend.",5
"In my second week here as i right, Hotel de France is within walking distance of town or has a shuttle service, there are numerous bars and restaurants in the hotel and food is excellent . The staff are all friendly and helpful, hotels facilities include a lovely indoor pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and spa.Great place to stay whatever the occasion .",5
"A minute from the town centre but surrounded by lovely well kept gardens - you wouldn't realise how close you really are to town. This truly is a hidden gem.  We took advantage of a quidsin.com deal they had for a 1 night stay.   While we were there, we used the spa facilities - beautiful large area with 1 big pool, a smaller pool and another shallow bathing area, also open to non residents. I have been to 3 other spas on the island and I have to say, this one was the best so far.   We ate dinner in the garden view restaurant as Saffrons was closed.  Dressing gowns, towels and slippers were provided.  Lovely big bed. I'm a very light sleeper and I can say I slept soundly through the night.  Staff were really friendly and accommodating.  Negatives: Only thing i could think of was…",5
"This is a huge lump of a place, you could easily find yourself lost in the corridors as the signing is not too good.  it has a great spa and a top notch health club, so go if thats what you want. Its a good distance down from the town and difficult to negotiate the way at first.  it took me rather longer than the suggested 10 mins to walk down! The beds were small even in their best rooms, and the pillows and linen were just cheep hollow fiber, not very comfortable im afraid.    For such a vast hotel with a renowned health spa you would think that there would be a call for some of the rooms to be suites, alas no. there are good views from the balcony, but the balconies are not private. ",4
Great hotel with very helpful and friendly staff. Hotel is spotlessly clean and has great facilities. The spa is amazing and treatments excellent. The quality of food in the Garden View restaurant is superb. I highly recommend a stay here.,5
"It was a fantastic place to stay. Facilities,  venu, staff all amazing. Overall great value for a weekend.  Room was a little dated but don't let that that distract from the big room with fantastic  views over st Helier",5
Old fashioned quality and comfort in Jersey. Very enjoyable stay. The spa facilities are the best on the island - the pool is outstanding. The hotel is a little way out of St Helier but it is a short drive or walk. ,5
We stayed on the 1st April and would highly recommended booking the spa room. Beautiful rooms and a lovely view.  We had a relaxing day in the spa and then had a beautiful meal at saffrons restaurant which I would also recommend! The staff are always polite and I can not fault anything - our favourite hotel in Jersey and hope to be back soon.,5
"Came here a couple of days ago with my Uncle, Nan and Mum. It was astonishing! Not only was it the most beautiful hotel I have seen, but the food was incredible! Mum ordered the steak salad and the portion size was spot on. I had the fish and chips and it was the best I have ever had. The tartare sauce had a garlic undertone, the chips were seasoned beautifully and the fish was of a very high standard! Well worth every penny. Would recommend.",5
"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend. It is well managed, clean and has a selection of dining options. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is a hotel shuttle at various time into the town centre if you don't always fancy the walk. I hope to return again.",4
"I stay here twice a year and I am never disappointed with the rooms, spa, food and friendly service. Easy to park at the hotel and just a short walk into town. Room service is quick and served with a smile.",5
"This hotel is lovely, our room was immaculate, spacious, comfortable, we had an amazing view and had every thing we needed in it. The reception staff were all really friendly and couldn't do enough for you, the staff at breakfast and behind the bar in the evening not so friendly though which is a real shame. We stayed in jersey last year in a different hotel and the service in that hotel was far superior to hotel de France and unfortunately this put a little downer on our stay.  The hotel had a really relaxed feel about it and the spa area was amazing! If the service was better I would not have hesitated to give 5 star, it really is a shame how the lack of service lets the grand feel of the place down.",4
"Can't fault this hotel - the staff, facilities and cuisine were all top notch. It was my first visit to Jersey with some friends for a spa w.end and I'll be back for more. The spa was exceptional (the treatments we had were fab) and the pool side facilities very nice. The restaurant was great and waiters who smile and seem to enjoy their job! a miracle (so used to dour/unfriendly and grumpy London service). The hotel was great too - large but not unfriendly and the beds were so comfortable! My one flag would be the room's in summer - may suffer from the heat as we arrived to a glorious day (can't complain) and because the windows only open so far (being safety ones), there wasn't much air flow so it got very hot and stuffy quickly. But who's going to be in their room for long…",5
"We had a lovely two night stay at the hotel. The room had a great view , the bed was very comfortable & the location of the room, away from the lift, meant it was very quiet. We loved the pool & spa facilities & had a fantastic meal in Saffrons restaurant. The only down side was the cooked breakfast as it was very colourless and tasted bland. Apart from that, we would definitely return & have the continental breakfast instead. ",5
"A beautiful building, spotlessly clean, set close to the town of St Helier. The staff were helpful, pleasant, and very professional. The food was excellent and we would recommend the Saffron Restaurant - outstabding cuisine.",5
"Many good things :  - cleanness in general  - kind and helpful staff  - excellent breakfast and time large enough - good location - pleasant decoration in the hotel and in the room - swimming pool - good room cleaning   A few things to improve :  - the bed has a narrow width (140 cm width I think) and the mattress is not really confortable.  I have seen much worse but I have also seen much better. - some housekeepers speak really loudly in the hall very close to rooms at about 8 o'clock. For people in holidays, it is really not pleasant. ",4
I would recommend this hotel wether for business or pleasure.  Exceptionally comfortable in every respect.  The staff went out of their way to be helpful.  I would not hesitate to stay here in future and highly recommend to anyone else. ,5
Fantastic hotel with great views and friendly staff. Rooms was very comfortable with a great bed. Breakfast was well presented and a great variety of hot and cold options. Recommend this hotel for value and comfort.,5
"This hotel is beautiful, sitting back from the main road thus no traffic noise in any bedrooms.  Wonderful comfy beds and spacious bar and separate sitting areas in reception.  The staff were friendly and so professional.  Nothing was too much trouble.....and the breakfasts were to die for !!",5
large imposing hotel when you arrive. reception site are pleasant and helpful. upgraded to balcony room which was lovely. superb grounds which we used as the weather was beautiful for sunbathing. spa was lovely for a pre evening swim before dinner would highly recommend this hotel to anyone although anyone with walking difficulties may find the hill difficult when returning to the hotel although they do provide a free minibus we enjoyed is so much we are returning this July,5
"We spent 3 days getting there from Manchester by Flybe because of the fog. Flybe couldn't be faulted with our arrangements. The Hertz car hire was great. The Hotel de France was exceptional,breakfasts were very good especially the crisp croissants and the choice.My Family joined me and were made very welcome although only one out of the 12 had food!! I also made use of their pool and the Ayurveda spa which was so peaceful and over the next two days helped my back pain immensely.This is a hotel I would recommend to anyone who wants to be spoiled and likes peace.",5
A very pleasant stay . Staff were friendly and helpful and the room and other areas of the hotel were spotlessly clean. Food in the restaurant was delicious. Our daughter in law loved the spa area. Sadly we didn't have time to sample it . ,5
"A big hotel, on high ground towards the back of St Helier, Jersey's main town. Plenty of free parking. Nice room, with great views over St Helier. The room would have benefited from a table lamp on the dressing table to improve the lighting. Good over-bath shower. The highlight was the indoor pool area, with a good-sized main pool, nice massage therapy pool, huge steam room, excellent changing rooms and plenty of loungers around the pool area for relaxation. Service at breakfast wasn't great, but the breakfast buffet itself was fine. It's an easy 20-minute walk into town (and there is a free shuttle bus a few times a day).",4
Stayed for two nights earlier this month and can honestly say this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in plus the food in the hotel restaurant was outstanding ~ a rarity these days. Can not recommend this hotel enough. Many thanks from Jane Byron. ,5
"Booked a 4 night stay for my birthday, was almost 3 thanks to appalling airline, the check in was swift but wished we could have done the formalities in the morning as we'd endured a 13 hour delay & were exhausted, I'd contacted the hotel in advance to request rooms close together, they were on the same floor but opposite ends of the building, the room we were allocated was huge (overlooking the restaurant) may have been a junior suite, it was lovely albeit a bit dated by comparison with our friends whose room was less than half the size of ours (overlooking the spa) but clearly recently refurbished & beautifully decorated. The exterior, sweeping staircase & comfortable well furnished foyer make for great first impressions. Breakfast was outstanding, more food than you could…",5
"We stayed ere in a Spa room for 3 nights for my wife's birthday. The room was excellent, very light and airy with great views across St Helier ( avoiding the Spa Roof). A large bathroom with great walk-in shower. The public rooms were lovely and the hotel had a nice air about it. Unfortunately it was let down by the quality of the buffet breakfast. It is difficult to cater for a large number of people but smaller serving trays so that fresh food was turned over more quickly rather than sitting there drying up would be an improvement. Also I don't understand why it is so difficult to ensure that bakeries provide proper loaves at the right time so that they are available for breakfast rather than just plain sliced bread. Such a shame as the hotel deserves better.",4
A charming relaxing hotel steeped in old style glamour. Helpful and friendly staff making your stay comfortable.  Plenty of amenities to hand plus only  a short walk to the main centre for shopping and other activities.  A fab relaxed atmosphere enhanced by the ooh so cool spa ,5
"The hotel is central to St Helier, but not on the port edge. The de France has  on-site parking and all facilities plus for a 4 star hotel.. Very welcoming staff, very clean hotel hotel, and good rooms.. In St Helier I doubt you will find better. Certainly not the Harbour front properties. Outside of  St Helier there are some great beaches with 3/4 star good hotels, but there will undoubtedly a premium to pay for those. We went in early March, and personally given the surprising amount of traffic  with locals seeming to like big 4x4s , we could never see us visiting in high season.  The St Malo-St Helier Condor ferry can be  can bouncy, so if you are prone to motion sickness, take precautions.. We had one journey cancelled because of the wind and heavy seas, which is not usual,…",5
Central location with excellent facilities l  This is a large hotel but welcoming and friendly. The spa and pool are excellent and rooms are bright and cheerful. Lovely staff and great choice of eating out in the hotel restaurants.,5
"This is a lovely hotel, a combination of old style French with a built on spa.  Positives: staff - every member of staff from reception, bar, restaurant, cleaning are lovely and polite. The Spa staff were exceptional.  Cleanliness-  the hotel is spotless and rooms cleaned to a high standard.  Garden restaurant- food was delicious, elegantly presented and service amazing. I'm summer with doors open I expect it is even better  Room - spotless bathroom and nice bath and shower.  Spa - we used all the facilities in the spa, and I had a treatment which was amazing. I felt totally pampered.   Not so positive: room - had been repainted beautifully but it was bare, it desperately needs pictures. The blind on the window and no curtains made the room echo. The wardrobe hinges are tight…",4
"I just spent a very enjoyable long weekend with my sister in Jersey staying at the Hotel de France. The hotel room was very clean and comfortable with a corner view of the garden. They had a small car park where we parked our hire car. As it was off season it was very quiet. The gym and spa at the hotel is excellent. We had a relaxing massage and enjoyed the swimming pool, steam and sauna facilities. The staff were warm and friendly. The breakfast buffet was generally good. The hotel was very nice and I would recommend as an excellent base to enjoy the island of Jersey.",4
"We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon 42 years ago and wanted to spend our anniversary here.  The staff are amazing and everyone looked after us so well.  There was even a bottle of bubbles and a bowl of fruit in our room which was a very kind gesture. We appreciated this very much.  It is a wonderful old building, full of character and lovingly restored to a high standard.  We ate in the Garden Room Restaurant and had 4 lovely meals.  On the night of our anniversary Annilee the Manager of the Restaurant (sorry if that's the wrong spelling) presented us with a plate of chocolate and strawberries wishing us a Happy Anniversary.  She really is a superb member of staff and will go far.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay even though the weather was foggy all the time and we were…",5
"hotel looking a little tired south side ,breakfast not warm could not understand staff very well were looking forward to a nice meal ended up with fish and chips as only served  indian cuisine of I do not like",3
"The usual superb service and comfort. I had to stay an extra night due to a flight cancellation. The staff made this easy for me even though all single rooms were booked. Twin room at a reasonable rate for a single. Breakfasts are wonderful, particularly the fresh pastries.",5
Third visit to Jersey to assess archers as coaches. Found this hotel on my second trip. I came back because they looked after me so well the first time. My second visit was just as good. Front of house reception staff are wonderful. The manager of the garden restaurant is fantastic. Nothing is too much trouble. I need another e cause to come back,5
Our stay was relaxing and our meal superb. We were made welcome at every opportunity and the spa facilities were excellent. We would not hesitate to return again at some time in the not too distant future.,5
"Staff very friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The in-room bathroom and plumbing could do with an upgrade. Price is a little high for the value of the room but the breakfast on offer makes up for that. ",4
"We stayed here as part of a package trip with Secret Escapes (SE) and Channel Escapes (CE). Our arrival was delayed a day, due to fog. I rang the hotel, as a courtesy to let them know we wouldn't be arriving as planned (so that they could let the room if needed) only to find out that I didn't have a double room as requested. I should have been told this by SE and CE so that I could cancel before the planned departure. The hotel only had small twin rooms left and didn't want to offer me a room up-grade. On arrival I paid for the up-grade as I enjoy holidays because I sleep with my lovely wife of 35 years.  I felt that staying for only 3 nights instead of the 4 nights of the booking, should have offset the charge for the up-grade- but no........ Also a confusion with the value of…",2
"Went away for a long weekend the hotel was lovely, the room was clean and very comfortable, the staff were friendly the only slight disappointment was the breakfast, everything was there but the cooked breakfast was warm and seemed like it had been out a while, the other restaurants were excellent, we had spa treatment and this was first class overall top hotel.",5
"We have just had a lovely weekend here - the staff were really friendly and helpful, breakfast was lovely and the rooms are a good size with a lovely bathroom with a good sized bath and nice shampoo etc!  We had a 5th floor room with great views over St Helier and we could see the sea! Town is just a 10-15 min walk away and there is free parking. There is also a hotel shuttle bus to the town. The pool and gym are part of the price with a beautiful spa - so well worth a visit.   The owners have totally refurbished this hotel and it really is lovely",5
"Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, I had high hopes for the Hotel de France. However, unfortunately my partner and I were disappointed with the reality. The décor in the hotel was dated and the hotel looks tired. The room we had (a 'standard' room) was clean, but very small and basic and the view was not very nice at all (it overlooked a roof). The room looked nothing like the picture on the website. No amenities such as a mini bar or fridge, although these are also not mentioned on the website so perhaps our fault for not looking into this beforehand. Wifi in the room was very fast.  The breakfast buffet was quite comprehensive (full english or cereals as well as fruit, yoghurt, toast, pastries and meats, smoked salmon and cheeses), although the quality was not fantastic.…",3
"I received a free upgrade to a spa room I loved it. Everything was of amazing quality, from bedding to bathroom amenities. Yes, there is always room for some improvement, I would have liked some herbal teas in the room in addition to black tea and instant coffee, and complimentary water would have been great. Overall though I was impressed and had a very comfortable stay.   The spa is absolutely beautifully designed and really relaxing. I thought water was a bit cold in the hydrotherapy pool but overall - great facilities.  I had dinner in the Garden View restaurant and the food was really enjoyable.   All in all, would love to come back.",5
"The rooms are large warm and comfy and the staff are very welcoming and cannot do enough for you. The pools swimming pool and spa are fabulous ,the reason why we booked and we are so glad we did ,it was a godsend ! Breakfast is buffet style and certain things can be ordered freshly prepared ,there is a huge choice so everyone is catered for. We will return ,but the only negative (if that's the word )is there is a steep hill / steps upto the hotel.",5
"My birthday treat this year was in this delightful hotel perched on the hill overlooking the town with a view of the sea. I loved the decor which made me feel cheerful and comfortable. Inviting sofas and armchairs, bright modern flowers and paintings of libraries and books helped me relax as well as the visit to the exceptional spa where I had a cooling treatment. As regards the retaurant Garden View I shall praise the service by the friendly and efficient staff as much as the quality of the food I tasted. The cress soup was out of this world, I also loved the pork belly and the chicken dish. Wines were well selected too and a tray loaded with a variety of desserts was presented at the end of each dinner: all of a very good quality. The room was spacious and comfortable, had a…",5
"We had a three night stay here.  The atmosphere of the hotel wasrelaxed and friendly.  We took our toddler who was equally welcomed in the spa pools and restrurant on site.  The room was large, clean and furnished well.  The bathroom was dated,  but the rest easily made up for it.  We will be back!!",5
"Visited for the second time on business.  This time I took my wife for a Spa break. The staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. The garden restaurant serves excellent food at a reasonable price. The restaurant manager was especially hospitable. Her attention to detail is commendable.",5
"The staff were very welcoming. The highlight of our stay was the restaurant, Saffrons, and the beautiful, clean spa. The room was clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay at Hotel de France again!",5
This is my third visit to the Hotel de France and by comparison with other hotels in St Helier the standard is excellent and surpasses that of others in the town that may be closer to the centre.  It is an alternative well worth comparing and the swimming and other facilities are an added bonus,5
"My wife and I enjoyed an overnight stay recently. The spa was relaxing as ever, coupled with a delicious meal in the Garden Restaurant and a great night's sleep - the perfect getaway and start to the weekend. ",5
Good health club breakfast nice could be in a brighter room staff friendly and efficient   I thought it was good value for money  and I have no problem recommending this hotel as a very good place to stay ,4
An excellent hotel with fabulous facilities and friendly and superb staff. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The spa facilities are superb. The breakfast was very good indeed. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5
"Second time staying at Hotel de France.  GOOD POINTS:  Lifts. Single room, reasonably roomy, modern, all the usual facilities. Tea and coffee making facilities with generous supplies of tea/coffee and packaged milk. Toiletries in bathroom. Comfortable slightly larger-than-single bed with duvet. Adjustable temp and A/C. Flat-screen TV with most UK plus French, Italian, German, RTL channels.  Armchair and side table in addition to desk and chair and a bedside table. Trouser press. Safe. Excellent multi-choice breakfast all self serve in large restaurant. Only place I've seen that has HP sauce and ketchup in those Tiptree small jam pots! Several restsurants on site. LESS THAN HAPPY FEATURES: Arrived off early flight at 0800. Went straight to hotel as it was raining hard. No point…",3
"Just stayed at the Hotel de France for the second time and the standard of care, food rooms and staff are brilliant. We had a spa room which was brilliant. We ate in the fantastic saffron restaurant and had the taster menu with accompanied wines. My wife is gluten free and was completely looked after by the chefs. I will right another separate report about the restaurant but will still say its special. Breakfast are good but although we didn't eat the cold meats, cheese smoked salmon it was the one area that looked dull, little choice and rather stale. If this area is not popular then a good variety and small amounts of each would help safe waste but look appealing. We will return again next year for our break at Jersey.",5
"Very grand looking hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Food was amazing in the retaurants, Saffrons is a very special dining experienxe. Standard of breakfast was average. Pool are is lovely, but overly busy on the day we went and not quite the relaxing experience we were hoping for. ",3
"I spent 2 nights at the Hotel De France while working on the Island. The staff are friendly & helpful, and the breakfast was fantastic. Also has a modern gym with a luxury swimming pool. All in all I found it to be the perfect hotel. ",5
The rugby was on and I really wanted to enjoy a pint and the atmosphere of watching it in a bar type setting. Sadly the bar did not open till 5pm and although I could buy a beer in the restaurant (where other diners were eating) I would have to take the beer to my room or the tv room. It may be worth getting a staff member in as it would have capped off a perfect stay but all in all it was a great night and Saffrons was toptastic ,5
Nice hotel. Excellent but ver expensive spa ans wellness centre.  The spa guest rooms are spacious but in need of refurbishment.  Lovely rooms but the downside is you have a view of the swimming pool roof!!! Breakfast cold and not worthvthe money,3
"My wife and I booked 4 nights for last week in this splendid hotel - junior suite - very spacious, and very comfortable - little knowing that we would be staying longer than intended due to Jersey Airport being closed for lengthy periods due to fog! We were then allocated yet  another spacious room in the modern extension - very different, but still very comfortable, which was important, as we had an extra 36 hours to kill! The building is vast, like a French chateau, but beautifully presented in every respect, and the standard of housekeeping is so good that my very own 'Hyacinth' was very impressed indeed. As for the staff, without exception, they were so pleasant, so courteous and so helpful, especially when we were originally faced with a possible complete cancellation of…",5
"Having been delayed by fog for two days I had an extended stay at the Hotel De France, the Spa facilities were excellent and the staff exceptional. I would strongly recommend the Hotel for both business and leisure and will be returning soon. ",5
"Our stay at the Hotel de France was in every way a delight.  The staff were really friendly, helpful and could not have been more so.  The whole experience, was one that did not only make you want to return, but to never leave.  The facilities are vast, they really have everything at hand.  There is even a complimentary shoe shine service!  The room we stayed in, was generous with space, the décor was beautiful and calming.  The bed was massive and so comfortable.  The cleanliness of the room was immaculate.  The room had coffee/tea facilities which were of a high standard and perfectly clean.  There was a dressing area, a sitting area and large bathroom.  A hair drier, trouser press and safe were all within the room, to save having to request items.  We had a massage during our…",5
The spa was the primary reason we booked the hotel as we thought it would be a lovely treat how wrong we were. They charged locals twenty five pounds for the day access for which they got a towel and a lounger. This meant that all the lounges were full of towels for the whole day as they were not letting them go. So no one on them. But no where to sit. Then no robes locker keys or sandals. Apparently they usually do but they were busy. They had filled with very very unsavoury people. Couples were being very intimate and I mean man on woman intimate in all the pools and the furthest pool had complete massages followed by the works . It was disgusting a man was under neath a woman in the main pool until I actually stood and stared them down. They waited for me and my kids to leave…,2
Excellent Spa and lots of room to walk around and relax very enjoyable.  Saffrons was really good – great food great service – Lawrence was very helpful and attentive he is an excellent restaurant manager  ,4
"Sorry I don't have any photos!  Being a Jersey lass I saw a nice deal on quidsin and decided to treat myself and my boyfriend to an overnight stay with full use of spa, pool and sauna rooms with breakfast included.  When checking in .. the staff couldn't be any nicer and were so helpful. (Having worked in the hotel business this is what you expect) Although we did not have dinner in the hotel we then came back and had a lovely chilled evening watching TV with a nice cuppa tea.  The room was absolutely gorgeous! Absolutely massive, light and very spacious and also very clean. Breakfast the next day was marvellous. We were greeted with a waitress with a lovely big smile and was very pleasant. The breakfast was lovely and has plenty of choice too. (Very good for veggies and for…",5
"Came out on a business trip with my husband but planned an extra night to make the most of it. Hotel fabulous, very clean, staff so friendly and efficient. Although it's a huge hotel it has an independent personal feel. Food for breakfast and restaurant superb. Walked into town and found it all very easy to navigate. Will definitely stay here again. Thank you hotel de france.",5
"We loved everything to do with our stay, Friday to Sunday, very nice and relaxing SPA as well as most friendly staff, very good value, excellent breakfast and would have no reservation recommending it to anyone!",5
We have just stayed here at the weekend and had a lovely time - we were bought a voucher from one of our children as a Christmas present - it was fabulous.  From arrival and the warm welcome from reception to the spa which was a little bit of heaven and the food in the Garden View restaurant was top notch - everything was special - would definitely recommend staying here.  My only little niggle was the size of the bathroom - the room was huge but the bathroom was tiny and could only fit one person in at a time which was a surprise - but it did not spoil our weekend.,4
"Stayed for a weekend break and the from the moment we walked through the door the staff were polite and professional, the building had beautiful character and the spa well was luxurious to say the least. Breakfast was included and can say was one of the best hotel breakfast I've had. The only downside I found was the bed, it was to soft for me but still I managed to sleep in this lovely relaxing hotel. ",5
"this hotel is superb. the pool & facilities are fabulous. if you can stretch to some treatments you won't be disappointed. not cheap but well worth it.  the staff, without exception, were friendly & helpful. the room we had on first floor was more than adequate & the food was excellent. We will be booking again",5
"Love staying at this hotel! Staff helpful and friendly,food lovely and pool/spa area is great. The rooms we've stayed in are always clean and very spacious. We always stay in the spa wing and have recommended this to friends,we are looking to book our 3rd trip here. ",5
great hotel with lovely comfy rooms. the pool and spa are a great  place to relax and all so clean. staff are very friendly and are very helpful. My only complaint was the cooked breakfast in the morning could of been hotter but there certainly was plenty choice,5
"Had a superb 3 night break, hotel was clean and friendly, in a convenient position our room which had a balcony had a lovely view over the town and distant coastline.the one way traffic system is slightly challenging,but eventually mastered it.",5
Lovely hotel and Spa - treatments are amazing :)   Don't upgrade to room with balcony if you wish to smoke as it's not allowed.   Also bread took to long to toast at breakfast.   Other than these minor points the stay was lovely and relaxing :),4
"This Hotel is lovely, the staff are really freindly and helpful the rooms are very nice, they are spotlessly clean and have ample room, the Spa is the best in Jersey and for breakfast there is so many choices, all was excellent.",5
"The original hotel is an imposing building, unfortunately obscured by an ugly 1970s extension.   Staff are very pleasant and rooms are fine (although plastic shower curtain over the bath was a cheap touch, and the desk in my room needed a light - which staff supplied promptly on request)   The Garden Room restaurant is informal but herb-stuffed pork belly was excellent and reasonably-priced. Service was a bit haphazard though - inattentive and long gaps.   But the music was truly dreadful and would deter me from staying again. At dinner it was aggressive garage (?) which was changed to something blander on request. At breakfast it was inane pop/chat which was turned down slightly.   Shame that this spoilt the hotel for me. If your taste in music is different then it may be fine…",3
I had a nice time there the room was perfect. The place was comfortable and cosy. Big and spacious. The food was alright not to my taste but all in all it was a great experience and I hope to come again.   Thanks,3
"Second visit to this hotel. Didn't disappoint. Welcoming staff, with excellent facilities. The Spa was a welcome distraction given the poor weather. The rooms were comfy and the breakfast was superb. What more can I say?",5
"I stayed here on the weekend of the 3rd of Fevruary to celebrate my 50th Birthday. My Sister and her partner surprised me by also booking a stay here. Andrea helped my Sister prepare my room with birthday banners, balloons, champagne and cake which was a wonderful surprise. The staff at this hotel are really the key to it's success and they should be praised for their professional and friendly service. We booked a Spa room on the second floor and it was a very large comfortable room. The spa facilities are excellant and it was a real treat to relax in there after a day's sight seeing. There was plenty of choice at breakfast and the extra items you can choose on the menu such as omelettes and smoked haddock are a nice extra. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a…",5
Thoroighly excellent one night stay in a beautiful hotel with fantastic facilities.  The pool is wonderful and breakfast was out of this world.  Staff excellent.  Lovely view from the room.  Can't wait to go again.,5
"Lovely Facilities, Gym and Spa amazing. Nothing was too much trouble I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to all. Ideal for Business or Leisure stays. The Food was reasonability priced and fantastic quality with a good selection including specials (that changed daily) available.",5
"Beautiful views, great breakfast & superb leisure facilities set you up for the day. Service was really good, had dinner there one evening and steak was really nice. Stayed in a spa room which are well worth the extra fee, very spacious and a beautiful bathroom.",5
Would definitely recommend the spa  rooms they were  spacious with lovely views over the town. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. The spa is out of this world and would definitely suggest using it . ,5
"Can I admit that we took a 'Quids-in' voucher overnight stay and that we only live 10 minutes up the road?  We were looking forward to an overnight here with access to the spa and breakfast included. We were not disappointed.  Sure, it didn't start too well; we arrive to check in only for the receptionist to decide to answer the phone instead of deal with us. I cannot stand this, how can you judge that the ringing phone is more important than the live and paying customer in front of you?  Seething, we make our way to our bright and airy room and we begin to relax. A couple of hours in the magnificent spa and a fantastic lunch in the Garden Restaurant and all is well in the world.  The hotel is beautifully maintained and, although large parts of it are closed at this time of year…",4
"Welcoming staff with an eye for detail and great service, comfortable room, great buffet breakfast, mouthwatering main meals and a superb spa - what's not to like? Ample parking, easy walking distance from St Helier town centre and so many island delights to savour - sights, activities and food choices to suit any palate and pocket. We spent 6 wonderful days on Jersey and were so glad we chose this hotel as our base.",5
"The hotel is lovely, we had a big room, very clean and well maintained.  The swimming facilities are outstanding.  On arrival the reception were very welcoming and extremely helpful.  We ate in the restaurant located on the first floor, based on indian cuisine.  What a wonderful meal, so original and looked stunning, it tasted fantastic.  Very impressed with Hotel de France, can't wait to stay again.",5
Stayed here for three nights whilst in Jersey on Business.  Two floors of the hotel were being re-carpeted so some facilities were reduced but every single member of staff here could not have been more helpful and seemed genuinely concerned that your experience would be the best.  Little touches like asking if they needed to arrange transport on checking out just meant that you felt as if your custom was really appreciated.  Have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.  Consider to be excellent value for money.,5
This hotel is very well located and spa area is one of the beat on the island staff are very friendly and always want to do more to help you rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable restaurant should have a better choice ,4
"I have reviewed this hotel before on trip advisor and this was our third trip to this hotel in just over 12 months - the only place my husband feels he can truly relax - but this time we went back as a family, with friends - 6 of us in total. Another great stay made better that we went out of season this time. The excellent staff, and facilities, marvellous breakfast, and the outstanding food and service in Saffron's restaurant made our stay complete. See you again in 2017!! Keep up the good work!!",5
Excellent service and facilities. Friendly and efficient staff. Room well appointed and food excellent.  Use of highly rated Spa recommended. This the second time I have stayed at the Hotel this year. Both times I have been equally impressed by the experience.,5
"Great location, short walk to town centre but still peaceful.  Amazing spa and gym.  Rooms and hotel clean.  Staff polite, helpful and cheerful.  We dined in the Garden View Brasserie.  Our meal was delicious.  Service and staff  were great.  We had a great welcome to breakfast, where they catered for  most if not all requirements.",5
"Regularly stay here on business trips - good spa and pool, good restaurant, well cooked steaks, Saffrons is fantastic for a more up market curry experience. Staff always helpful, rooms reasonably priced",5
"I booked this as a treat for myself and my mum and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We had booked two massages in the spa and had a 5* experience and the pool facilities were spotless. The room was clean, very comfortable and had a great view from the 5th floor. We had afternoon tea booked in the Garden view restaurant, the staff were friendly enough but unfortunately I found mouldy fruit on my tart and the sandwiches were all dried up which I assume was because they had not been made fresh. We were the only ones in the restaurant eating at the time so the effort could have been made to prepare a fresh batch, but instead they were just taken out of a rotating cabinet at the front of the restaurant. The scones were beautiful but everything else was completely stale which was…",4
"You are always made welcome at the Hotel De France and its good value,We have been visting the hotel for the past 20 years , it is close to town and plenty of car parking ,The swimming pool and fittnes center are great .",5
"All round experience was really good. The Spa is exceptional, including the Ayush Wellness centre where we had excellent treatments. The hotel as always, very comfortable, food/drink all good and the friendliness of staff was very good.  ",5
Stayed overnight after an Christmas party. Was a really cheap rate and an excellent breakfast. Had a good day in the pool and spa facilities the next day as well. Vey relaxing. The bathroom is slightly dated but otherwise it was a very comfortable and clean experience.,5
"Due to a Christmas party that we were not forewarned about, despite only booking 2 weeks in advance, we were unable to sleep in our room. So in the middle of the night we were moved to an inferior twin room on our anniversary. The following morning at reception we were offered a paltry £25 as compensation. When we said this was unacceptable they offered a derisory £30. We stated this was unacceptable and after a total of 30 mins we were refunded the room. At no point did the duty manager come and speak to us, instead they sent a nervous receptionist out to us. It's a shame because she and all other colleagues were lovely. The spar and saffron restaurant were fantastic, but the terrible service at the end has left a sour taste.",2
had a fantastic overnight stay my only complaint would be no fridge in the room. However for one night not really an issue. Service of staff was great no issues at all. The good and service in saffrons was amazing!! ,5
"We stayed here for a few nights in early November for a mix of leisure and business. The hotel was clean and friendly and our room, one in the new extension, was roomy and well appointed. As it was the end of the season there wasn't much open on Jersey as all the tourist attractions seem to close at the end of October - also much is closed on Monday and Tuesdays. ST Aubin has some good restaurants but again many were closed so didn't get to sample them. The local busses are a great way of getting around. The hotel runs a shuttle bus into St Helier three times a day.",4
"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. It is not cheap but for Jersey the value is excellent. Staff were extremely helpful and efficient. The hotel has a very pleasant ambiance, and on site sporting facilities are second to none. The food was good and the breakfast choice and restaurants on site varied. In addition, this hotel is 3 to 5 minutes walk from a large supermarket, 10 minutes walk to the city centre and 15 minutes walk to the beach front. The view from the terrace over Saint Helier is also lovely. I can really recommend this. I am a seasoned and discerning traveller but have found my firm choice for Saint Helier.",5
"Having stayed at the Hotel de France before, it was everything I expected from the warmth of the welcome and friendly and efficient staff to when I had to checkout. The hotel id comfortable and the food excellent. What more could you want?",5
"I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to spend time in Jersey. The hotel  management surprised us with gifts on our wedding anniversary, the staff are so friendly, the rooms are lovely and very clean, efficient shuttle service and the meals at the restaurants (The Orangery, The Garden View, and Saffrons) were succulent!  We also had a relaxing and great time at the Ayush spa and the gym. We will definitely stay at Hotel de France when next we visit Jersey! ",5
Room on 4th floor with views of St Helier centre and sea. Easy walk to the shops and waterfront. Car parking available at no charge. The food in the brasserie was surprisingly good quality. Would not hesitate to stay again.,4
"Ayush spa is lovely, but we weren't allowed to use Healthhaus gym. Friendly and very helpful staff throughout hotel. Room wasn't very big but was lovely with great views over St Helier. 5 minute walk into town centre.",4
Such a relaxing night away. Spent hours chilling at ama big pool facilities. Treatment was great. Room service good value. Only bizarre thing is breakfast is served in a room with no windows. They should definitely think about changing this.,4
"I will always stay at this hotel; however, this is one downside, and it's the hard mattresses and lumpy pillows. For everything else, it gets top marks! Hotels need to learn that hard mattresses are a false economy.",5
"Very comfortable, we visited out of season on a business trip and found it very quiet, pleasant and with excellent attentive service. Really loved the pool area and the amazing dark blue pools- most relaxing. Extremely good value.",5
"From ample parking on arrival, friendly helpful reception staff, great value single rooms, friendly bar staff and closeness to the bars and restaurants in the town I could not fault anything. My only disappointment was that I had to leave really early for an event so missed breakfast, w2hich I have been told is as good as everything else",5
"Good family hotel, excellent service and facilities.  Not to far from the centre of St Helier. We enjoyed the spa facilities in the evening. The breakfast was enjoyable, from fruit to fried breakfast. The staff were always helpful  ",5
My return to hotel de France as always friendly professional staff good value for money shuttle service spa restaurants & 24 hour tuc shop couldn't fault it & the restaurants excellent food & breakfast is as always amazing  👍5-5 ,5
"I enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea today with my daughter.  The welcome was so warm and inviting, very friendly staff, especially to Vicky today.  Excelllent value and delicious cakes, sandwiches and tea.  Peaceful setting there today with views out into the well maintained garden areas.  Such a breath of fresh air to visit somewhere which is really so friendly here in Jersey, as I often find the opposite with many places I go to locally.  We even left with a lovely gift box with the cakes we didn't manage to finish to take home, a lovely gesture, thank you.",5
"A wonderful hotel just 10 minutes from the centre of town. Excellent staff who are committed to making your stay a thoroughly great experience.  Nothing is ever too much troubleWonderful food, great vegetarian dishes, great wireless broadband, even free sports channels.  A great business hotel. ",5
"We have just spent 10 blissful days in November in the Hotel de France. The weather was very poor, but the hotel more than made up for it. Our room (a spa room) was bigger than expected, had a great bathroom, very comfortable bed and was very quiet at night. The Garden View restaurant in the hotel was just right for - good food, not too pricey and open all day. Saffrons (Indian influenced fine dining) was simply superb - expensive but worth every penny (especially the Paneer tikka korma!!) Then there is the gym (the biggest, best equipped gym I have ever used with helpful staff and great facilities) and the spa - truly wonderful! A big swimming pool, massage pool, sauna, steam room etc. etc... We spent many relaxing hours pampering ourselves, and there is a vast range of…",5
"The Hotel was excellent. The staff were helpful happy and friendly. Our room on the 3rd floor was comfortable and quiet, with a good view. We started with a fantastic massage at Ayusha and spent the evening enjoying a wonderful meal at Saffron's restaurant. We had the 'Tasting menu' with accompanying wines, and the staff were excellent and attentive.",4
Lovely hotel with great spa facilities.   I have stayed here a number of times for business and each time I have enjoyed my stay.   Breakfast was included in my rate and there is lots to choose from.   Rooms are comfortable and staff are very friendly.   A short walk takes you downhill into town (a taxi or bus back is the best option)  All in all a really lovely hotel and great if you want to spend the weekend relaxing and getting away from it all! ,5
"Very nice hotel with clean spacious rooms, The hotel has many restaurant facilities, some which are not open during the quieter winter period.  There are excellent leisure facilities including, Gym, Spa and Swimming pool.  The staff are pleasant and helpful",5
"We enjoyed the 55 minutes spa treatment a lot. The spa facilities in the hotel are great. You can still use the spa facilities on the day you checked out. Breakfast is amazing, a lot of food for you to choose.",5
"Spacious comfortable room, good breakfast, excellent health suite, wonderful Saffrons restaurant, good service, useful car park, walking distance to shops, but also free shuttle.   Faultless and always enjoyable.",5
"Had a long weeken here with my wife and young daughter. Excellent room 134 .large double bed and single bed. Dressing area and excellent bathroom. All very spacious.  Breakfast very good in the Orangery. Had one evening meal which was ok. Easy to walk into town, but I believe there is a courtesy bus.covered parking for car if needed. Excellent swimming pool . Will definitely use this hotel again.",5
"Stayed in this hotel for 3ngts and I genuinely have no complaints. Compared to this town the hotel does seem like the place (well in the winter months anyway).  The staff are friendly and helpful, even prior to arriving Dionne patient in dealing with and answering my many queries, upon arriving Julie too was extremely attentive and whatever she couldn't sort she got someone that could. My room spacious and orderly and the cleaning staffs too are to be praised for their seamless work. The breakfast is full-on with a wide variety of options. The restaurant too is well fitting for this x star hotel. The Spa, the Spa! Spent a lot of time here, morning, noon and night while I stayed at this hotel and the pools are varied with a steam room and sauna with a variety of massages…",4
"It has been many years since leaving the island and my return was to see family. I stayed at this hotel which I have known from my childhood having lived on the island for a number of years but never stayed at and was pleasantly surprised by how everything on the island has evolved/changed.  The rooms are light and airy, I stayed in 504. Very clean, Tea and coffee facilities, An In-room safe (free), A selection of Aloe Vera Soaps, shampoos and bath gel toiletries are in the bathroom which is handy if travelling light. The hotel also has a Laundry and Dry Cleaning services at ones disposal . I utilised the laundry service for trousers which were handed in at 9:30 and they were returned by 14:30.    Breakfast was very good, a vast choice from sweet pastries, cereals the usual…",5
"Fantastic relaxing weekend with friendly staff, great restaurants and spa what's not to love .Saffrons food is such a tasty well presented array of dishes really can't fault in any way . The spa is spacious and relaxing with a vast choice of treatments .",5
The hotel was very clean and well kept. The staff were so lovely and helpful and the breakfast was very high quality and plentiful. The spa facilities were just top-notch and the whole place has a wonderful sense of luxury to it. This was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in and I highly recommend it.,5
Over night stay we've stayed a lot with the girls and with my husband. We live in jersey and love spending the night there and using the lovely pool. It was a mini baby shower for me. Love laying by the pool,5
"We checked out the reviews of this hotel before booking and it lived up to all expectations. (When we first arrived, I drew breath.... as there is an ugly medical centre in front of it, however my mind was laid to rest as the hotel behind it was perfect).... The hotel is only about 20 minutes from the airport by taxi or you can take the excellent public bus services. The hotel public areas are all very clean, bright and fresh and the hotel staff were all efficient and friendly. (Special mention to the room cleaners who done a first class job, rooms were spotless). Our room was on the 4th floor looking out over St. Helier and the bay beyond and had everything you would want. The bed was a little soft for my liking but otherwise everything else was okay. Good quality towels and…",5
"We live in Jersey. It is a great place to live! In Winter we sometimes like to take up a special deal at one of the hotels and indulge in a 'staycation'. This one has been the best ever. Our room, a spacious junior suite on the third floor with views over St. Helier to St. Aubins Bay, was nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable with very soft sheets. The room was quiet and the heating fully adjustable.  The spa here is very large. The treatment centre is highly renowned and, as a guest, I found the steam room, sauna, large pool and massage pools etc to be clean and inviting with the lovely blue lighting.  We ate for the first time in the Garden restaurant for lunch and the quality was wonderful. Both my chicken and cashew nut korma and my husband's lamb tagine…",5
"The de France has been my families choice of hotel for many years and I returned this year with my wife, her parents and my daughter for a summer break. The hotel has two distinct parts, the modern spa and the more grand hotel. The spa rooms are worth paying for with the modern furnishings, walk in showers and views over St Helier. The rooms in the grander part of the hotel have recently been upgraded but lack air conditioning and rooms at the rear of the hotel have rather poor views. Part of the hotel has now been closed, and a member of staff informed me that this part was to be turned in to apartments. As a consequence, while the hotel used to encourage families, most facilities for children are no longer provided. I was disappointed that the buffet theme nights that were…",5
"First time in Hotel de France. I've booked a massage for my partner , and then we stayed in spa. Excellent customer service. Spa facilities in high standards.  Food in restaurant very good.Definitely recommend! And for sure coming back. ",5
"Limited vegetarian meals choice for dinner and lunch if you eat there more than 2 days, but nice food. Very good gym and pools, with long opening hours.  Wide choice of food at breakfast, although fruit salads did not taste nice. Probably a generic UK issue, where normally quality of fruit and vegetables is not the same as in the South of Europe, in my view. I will choose this hotel again. It's the 3rd hotel I try in Jersey and it's far above the previous ones, which were even more expensive.",5
The hotel was really lovely and in an excellent location. It was good to have plenty of parking.  The swimming pool area was great and the facilities clean and welcoming.  The choice of dining was very good.,5
"Last stayed here in 1974 and my, has it improved! Helpful, friendly, considerate staff, good food and our (spa) room was light, airy, smart and clean with high quality furnishings, a large bathroom with wet room shower and bath and a very comfortable bed. Spa is good with 3 pools, steam room and sauna.",5
"I visited jersey for a 4 day break and stayed at the Hotel de France.  I was thoroughly impressed at the standards at the hotel. The decor was lovely, the hotel was very clean and well kept, the staff are so friendly and courteous at all time.   The spa and swimming pools were great! They have 4 pools in one large room - plunge pool, swimming pool, massage pool and warm water shallow pool. It also had loungers situated around the pools. The decor was very nice, heated underfloor heating.  Their restaurant on the ground floor serves some lovely meals and I was thoroughly impressed at how friendly the staff were, we had built up a good rapport with them from the first day.  Overall, it was a welcoming and pleasurable experience and would definitley visit again",5
"I can well recommend A very good hotel for business visits - relaxed, generous surroundings and friendly staff, quite - a few hundred yards for the town centre but only 10-15 minutes walking distance.  Above all a feeling of relaxation and absence of stress.",5
"We booked this hotel to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and we were not disappointed.  The rooms were tastefully decorated with plenty of complimentary tea & coffee with a biscuit, some people will say they were small but how much time do you spend there anyway.  We were given two rooms at the front of the hotel with lovely views to the harbour.  The bathrooms were spotlessly clean with lovely little bottles of shampoo etc.  Breakfast was all you could want for and had everything from kippers to cereals.  The leisure facilities are out of this world, with a state of the art gym and the pool, steam & sauna rooms modern and up to date with lovely fluffy towels to use.  The only downside with the pool area were people putting towels on sunbeds but not actually going back to…",5
"Excellent hotel,location,staff , facilities and food. Staff very helpful but not in your face. Spa area is exceptional and really made such a difference on our midweek break. Saffron restaurant in hotel is something different, well worth looking at. ",5
"A great hotel! Good value, huge room and very well appointed. The only downside was that getting down late for breakfast on both mornings I found that the food options were run down with not everything being available",4
Recently booked a child free weekend away. On arrival at the hotel the check in was very warm and welcoming. All the facilities at the hotel were explained in detail. The room was very clean and this was throughout the hotel. Breakfast catered for all tastes so over all very good.,4
"Had a great 4 nights away at this hotel with my wife, it was clean tidy and well maintained with friendly staff where nothing was to much trouble, great spa facilities,would definitely stay here again highly recommended.",4
The hotel was lovely with friendly and efficient staff.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Lots of information available about Jersey and what's on.  Breakfast was exceptional with so much choice.  We had a very comfortable and well appointed room on the 4th floor with views over St Helier and the harbour.,5
"What an amazing hotel, we was here for 4 nights and we had a lovely time.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  The rooms were very comfy and very clean, we had clean towels every day and our room overlooked the town it was fantastic.  We had our first meal in the saffron restaurant which was a set menu it was the best meal we had had in a very long time  and we have been to loads of hotels and restaurants, it was outstanding an al a carte meal,3 courses and was only £40. We also ate in the brasserie the food there was of a very high standard. Would also like to mention the bar staff they were also very friendly.  While our stay in jersey we went over to France on a ferry and had a lovely day.  We will certainly be returning to this…",5
Our first visit to Jersey and used public transport to get to the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the spa was amazing. The manager at the Garden View restaurant was so welcoming and very friendly and she made it a very enjoyable time for  us. We booked a twin room and the beds were comfy and we slept extremely well. Overall we couldnt fault any of the staff who were all friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back to Jersey and stay at Hotel de France again.,5
"Stayed here with my wife for 4 nights as part of our 30th wedding anniversary holiday on Jersey.  We were in one of the Spa rooms which are in the modern extension of the hotel. The room was clean, spacious, comfortable and with a lovely view across St Helier. The fresh fruit and bottle of fizz in the room on our arrival helped set the tone. We found the staff very polite and helpful with no exceptions.  Breakfast had the usual selection of cereal, fruit, pastries etc and lovely creamy porridge. I found the cooked breakfast to be below par as it was lukewarm and a bit dry at times. It seemed that at the start of breakfast they filled up the serving dishes with lots of food and then kept it warm with heaters under the serving dishes.  We ate once in the restaurant next to the spa…",4
"Have wanted to stay here for some time. Spent three nights in October and was not disappointed. Very impressive entrance. Helpful staff throughout, particularly in the breakfast room and the brassiere style restaurant. We had a lovely garden view room, overlooking the roof tops of nearby St Helier.",5
We enjoyed our 2 night break at this lovely hotel. The executive suite had everything we needed and the bed was huge! The choice at breakfast time was more than adequate and in a very nice setting. Didn't manage to use the spa facilities and pool but they looked great. Managed to fit in an Indian head massage in the hotel salon which was lovely. Will definitely visit again.,4
"The picture look very grand but it not quite this Grand, Spa was very nice, sauna steam room are good nice pool, did not try treatments, quite expensive.  Breakfast was very good, nice choice of food, hot plates for cooked breakfast.  Bedrooms on the small side, only blinds on window so open or shut, Ie no natural light until dressed, ( get net curtains so you can have light) no view from room, tea coffee making facilities, but the smallest cups and tinyest glasses for water.   Bathroom fitted with no imagination,1 small shelf to put things on.  We ate in the garden room restaurant, good food good service and a good price.   Did not eat in main restaurant, looked very stuffy and very expensive.",4
Wonderful stay and a very Relaxing time had by all. Great service with friendly staff. The food was amazing in saffrons and we especially liked the taster menu. Nothing was too much trouble and we will definitely be back to use the wonderful spa facilities again ,5
"We stayed here for 6 nights to celebrate our 30th anniversary. The hotel has 3 main strengths. Firstly it is immaculately clean throughout. Secondly, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Thirdly, the spa area is very good and relaxing. Other features include a nice view over St Helier, good food for breakfast and a decent brasserie style restaurant. Often hotel restaurants are empty, but this was almost full when we went, and was pretty decent value. Unfortunately,quite a few mistakes were made when we went, including getting our order wrong. I have written a separate review for the Indian style restaurant Saffrons, which we found very disappointing.",4
Lovely ammenities with two excellent restaurants. Staff were so helpful and organised my last minute trip to St Malo. The daily shuttle bus was helpful but my tip would be to hire a car to get around more easily. ,5
"Wonderful spa, good quality breakfast, not so keen on the restaurants for dinner- not much choice on menu but everything else excellent. Great location, central St Helier, staff very helpful.  Do have a treatment if you have time, the best Ive ever had.",5
"A mixture old old world charm and modern convienience give this hotel a special charm. The service was excellent and the breakfast was the best.  I loved the poached haddock with eggs.  We ate in the Garden restaurant on Sunday night and the food and service were second to none.  A really nice meal in lovely surroundings.   Our room was not so good on this occasion, only because it had a poor view and was a little dark ( we had to put the light on most of the time). Apart from that the room was very comfortable.",5
"Family celebration with children and grandchildren to celebrate landmark birthdays for both my parents.  The rooms were very comfortable, the pool is excellent and the food in Saffrons was lovely (the children were able to order from the Garden View Restaurant menu and thoroughly enjoyed their meals).  The birthday cake was wonderful. The only criticism was the slow service in both the Garden View Restaurant for lunch (only sandwiches, but it took 45 minutes) and in Saffrons (it was busy, and I know it is fine dining so the pace tends to be more sedate, but even so it was a little too slow considering we had young children in our party).",5
"Having never visited Jersey before, the hotel was chosen more by luck than planning but what an amazing piece of luck. From the very beginning to the end we were made to feel so welcome. Every member of staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. Plenty of tea, coffee, toiletries etc. Breakfast was also plentiful! Amazing choice - fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, breads, cooked.... I only wish I could have eaten more. As for the Spa, I'll need to write a separate review - FAB-U-LOUS !! We definitely want to visit again. Highly recommended. ",5
"I booked a short break in this hotel as I present for our friends 60th birthday. I had stayed here 15 years ago and remembered it being good. I was even more pleased to see they had added an excellent spa and orangery. The hotel is about 15 minutes from the airport and a taxi costs approx £15 for 4. On arrival we have lunch on the terrace of the 'garden bar' in the beautiful sun, very tasty and reasonably priced. Our room was standard but adequate on the second floor with a lovely view across the island. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  We used the spa, with it's infinity pool and had the best hot stone massage, totally relaxing. It is about a 20 minute walk to town but only 5minutes in a cab. Breakfast had everything you could wish for and again staff were really…",5
"Our first time in Jersey. Lovely hotel. Had a delightful attic room on the 5th floor. Beautiful spa, very clean and great facilities and treatments and a separate gym. Three restaurants, Orangery for breakfast, Garden View for all day, but a great dinner and Saffrons, Indian fusion. Staff and service super everywhere. About 20 minutes walk to the centre/seafront. Will definitely return.",5
"This is a very nice hotel with lots of amenities that I would be more than happy to visit again. The whole hotel is immaculately clean, has a very good breakfast selection, has quality food in its restaurants and has excellent staff.  We had a standard room and whilst it was clean, tidy and perfectly functional I would look to upgrade my room on any future stays for mainly selfish reasons. I would have liked a fridge or mini bar in the room if only to store my medication along with a king size bed rather than a standard double.   Air Con was not available in our room. In October it is not an issue but could be problematic in any unusually hot weather.  The indoor pool area is excellent with a swimming pool, separate smaller pool with inclusive large jacuzzi and a walk through…",4
"Having never been to Jersey before we booked HDF based on previous reviews and images of the Hotel, but we were not disappointed. The standard double room was nothing luxurious but a comfortable bed is a must (a lot of hotels scrimp on cheap beds) and HDF did not disappoint. A beautiful decorated hotel with a lot of character and spotlessly clean. The breakfast was first rate with plenty to choose from on the buffet and Saffrons lounge bar was our destination of choice most nights. The Gin me was superb, if not a little expensive. Would certainly return.",4
"Just come back from a four day break in Jersey and stayed at the Hotel de France. From entering the hotel to leaving nothing was too much trouble and the service from the staff was above excellent. Arrived at the hotel at 9am after a flight from the UK and knowing we were early asked them to look after our luggage they looked and said our room was free and we could check in and have it there and then. Because we were leaving four days later very early in the morning I cheekily asked if we could have our breakfast now. No problem was the reply. Our room was excellent. The leisure facilities one of the best for this type of hotel. Evening meal in the bistro was first class, and the service from everyone was five star. Free shuttle bus from the hotel to town centre and return. Upon…",5
"Rare we can book last minute but we did for once, a Secret Escapes deal to Jersey.  We'd upgraded to the Spa rooms, well worth it but double check if you have kids.  Spa is great, but to be honest I love it when you have a team that seem to clearly be positive and show good professional judgement.  In both the Garden View restaurant, where the evening dinner staff were brilliant, and with Thomas the Duty Manager who resolved a booking issue smoothly the hotel has people that make the place far better than other hotels I've taken the family to.  It works, congratulations and I highly recommend a visit to anyone.",5
"The approach to the hotel takes you past a building resembling a 1960s Secondary Modern School. Then the frontage and reception cannot fail to impress when you get there however. We booked two single rooms thinking it would be two double rooms for single occupancy given the price and the apparent hotel quality. They were single bedded rooms. The fittings and decor were as the Swedes say, ""unmodern"". A razor point half way up a wall in the bathroom so does the electric toothbrush charger work? Errr no. No air con, andthe furniture faded and hopelessly out of date. Walking back to the hotel needs breathing apparatus to walk from the road to the hotel entrance. massively steep and a defibillator would't go amiss. Breakfasts plentiful but such as bacon in massive piles in congealed…",3
"Stayed here for three nights this week and although the place is spotless and well presented thought it lacked atmosphere. Chose a Spa room and got one nights decent sleep out of three. Night one had a function which went on late, noise from guests outside for a smoke on the ground floor plus guests arguing in the next room until 4am Second night someone started using some form of machine ( I assume in the spa area ) at 6am sounded like a motorbike in the next room --very inconsiderate Had a meal in the main restaurant on the first night and found it average compared to other restaurants in St Helier.  Sirloin steak was more like a large tough rump. One other small issue was despite an E-MAIL sent in advance on the hotels website that we were there to celebrate our 30th…",3
"Our room, booked though B.A.as well as our flight, was very airy and large with 3 windows overlookingSt Helier and the sea on a clear day, and the hotel sun lounger and refreshment area. The room was on the second floor and easily accessed by lifts or stairs. The outstanding feature of this hotel were the excellent and most helpful and always cheerful staff, never failing to do anything and everything to help. The geographic situation of the hotel was to the north of St, Helier at the top of a very steep climb from the main town, shops, restaurants, bus station etc such that  a taxi or a bus was needed to get back to the hotel if you were in a hurry, in the rain or just not very fit. We booked bed and breakfast at the hotel,thinking that we would be able to walk to restaurants…",4
"This is a truly wonderful hotel. Great helpful staff. Everywhere is exceptionally clean. We stayed for three nights friday to monday. Although the hotel was fully booked it never appeared busy.. We had a standard room which although not oversized was big enough. Tea and coffee making facility and safe in the room. Bathroom spotless and rooms cleaned daily. Very comfortable bar with drinks not ridiculously priced but higher than pub prices. Hotel is set up a steep bank and about 15 mins from the centre of St Helier. There is a courtesy bus to town which runs about 4 times a day if you don't want to walk.The indoor pool area next to the spa is superb. Besides the pool there is a steam room, Sauna, Hydro-pool and Cold Plunge Pool. We went in sunday evening it was dimly lit and so…",5
"Just back from a long weekend in Jersey where we stayed at this excellent hotel. The hotel exterior is absolutely immaculate, with a French chateau look. The grounds are also large and very well maintained. The hotel reception staff were vey friendly and helpful. Our standard room was well decorated, furnished, clean, if a little small. The bathroom was small, clean and adequate with bath and shower. My sporting days are over but for the young(er) more active there is a very good spa, pool and gym available. There is a choice of two restaurants- one traditional and one Indian plus breakfast is served each morning in large room with a glass pyramid overhead. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is only a 10-15 minute walk into the centre of St Helier but please be aware that…",4
We had a lovely large room (in the newer part) with an excellent large bathroom.  All was there which is required.  Staff were always welcoming and friendly.  About 20 minutes walk into the centre of St Helier but we usually got a taxi back.  Unfortunately time did not permit use of spa or pool but looked lovely.  Thank you for looking after us so well,5
"great place to stay , we stayed over as we were going to ball at the hotel .  the swimming pools were very good , a few to choose from . the staff were very helpful and friendly . the rooms were comfortable ",4
This is a great hotel to stay at.  On this occasion I went with a group of friends and there were great communal areas where we could all sit and chat.  The hotel is spacious and there was plenty of room for us without feeling like we were over filling any area.  The spa and the swimming pool were beautifully maintained and quiet.  Perfect for relaxation.,5
"Very plush hotel, great facilities and fast wi fi throughout so I could work any where in the hotel.  The Spa and leisure facilities were of high standard and the food at the hotel was divine.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and could not do enough to give me a great stay.  Looking forward to revisiting next year.",5
"We are a local family that used the hotel overnight as I had organized a large charity event. Not only was the hotel perfect for my event but the hotel, staff and services were excellent. Well done especially to Svetlana who I dealt with,  for her patience and professionalism. We will be back ! ",5
"We stayed for 4 nights and can think of nothing negative about this fantastic hotel. The beds were so comfy it was hard to get up in a morning, Breakfast was what I would have expected in this hotel, once again the service was exceptional. The spa is a must.",5
"This was the best hotel I have stayed at in Jersey.  The hotel staff was very friendly and welcoming. The Saffrans  restaurant was wonderful. This contributed to a truly relaxing break in Jersey. I have not tried the other activities offered by the hotel for lack of time, but I will surely tried at leat one of them during my next visit.",5
Lovely weekend spent with friends at this hotel The rooms were clean and the staff were very helpful  The spa is one of the best I have been to and the massage was luxurious  The bar is large with an excellent selection of cocktails all at a very reasonable price  Food in the terrace bar was hot and very tasty with huge portions  Can't wait to return ,4
"We loved the hotel. Friendly staff, excellent food and wonderful spa. We had a spa room because we wanted a walk in showers, and the room and bathroom were very comfortable. My one negative was that we felt our bed was'nt as comfortable as it could have been, and our duvet was very thick and heavy, although this was changed for a blanket. Overall a lovely hotel.",4
Cannot fault the hotel at all with the exception of cheap coffee in the rooms and no fridge.   The rooms are cleaned daily and  u can request breakfast in bed with only an additional charge of £2.50 and you shall receive exactly what is being served downstairs.   Absolutely fabulous spa facilities.  Honestly i cannot fault this hotel.   The negative reviews i have read re this hotel must be from the older generation who expect to have their mouths/bottoms wiped by the staff. ,5
"Stayed in this lovely hotel Monday 17 10 16 till Friday  21 10 16. Found it no problem  with the help of our Sat nav, the roads are all one way and narrow. Arrived about 8.00 in the evening,  staff on desk very warm and welcoming, and as I drive a large American  truck they made room for me to park at the main entance by moving a planter! If I went out they put cones there so it would be free when I returned. On getting to the room it was exactly what I wished for, roomy , comfy bed,  nice bathroom and a lovely view over the town. Also a kind gesture, flowers fruit and a bottle of wine for our anniversary. .nice... thankyou.  Swimming  pool was nice, clean warm, quiet, nice way to spend a couple of lazy hours. A couple of down sides tho I'm  sorry to say... Breakfast,  while a…",5
"Lovely spacious building, with the feeling of luxury about it. Helpful and friendly staff, comprehensive facilities and various levels of food and beverages available. Courtesy shuttle bus to take you into the shopping centre and sea front. Definitely recommended.",4
"The hotel has excellent facilities, particularly the pool and spa. The spa rooms are specious and well appointed, with views of the town. Staff is friendly and well trained. The hotel is all one could want for a short break for business or pleasure.",4
Freindly efficient staff. Lovely room with stunning views. Most comfortable bed I have ever had in a hotel. Well stocked room with nice large bath and powerful shower. Food was good and bars comfortable,5
"Hotel was a short journey from the airport. In a central location. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Hotel was spotless. Beautiful Spa to relax in after being out and about all day. Breakfast was extremely good, huge variety of food.",5
Tremendous value for money.  Excellent room; very comfortable and fully equipped.  Reception was exceptionally helpful.  I was travelling on my own but would have no hesitation in staying here with my spouse.,5
"The Hotel De France has a great pool with spa, sauna and steam room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Dinner in the brasserie offered a good choice with daily specials at a reasonable price. I stay in Jersey on a regualr basis and find the hotel offers good value for money",4
"This is a great hotel and we felt it was well worth the money we paid for our Executive room.  The staff are incredibly polite, cheerful and helpful.  The facilities are great, the breakfast was plentiful, varied and very good and the bars and restaurants didn't disappoint.  Being able to park out hire car here was really useful too.   The only thing which let this hotel down slightly was the room cleaning service.  We stayed for three nights and the cleaners did the bare minimum.  Towels and bins were changed, beds were made but that was it.  Dirty glasses were left behind, furniture was left out (we moved two chairs to a window one evening so that we could enjoy a glass of champagne while looking at the view), rubbish was left on the floor and desk and the bathroom wasn't…",5
"Superb modern hotel with old fashioned values. Couldn't fault the room, the staff or the food. Easy to walk to town, but out of the hustle and bustle. Would definitely recommend this hotel for that special event.",5
Stayed for 1 night with work so didn't get to make the most of all the facilities such as the spa and pool.  The first thing that stuck me was the size of the hotel - it's huge.  Staff were lovely and I had a very good meal in one of the restaurants.  Breakfast was good quality and the room very comfortable. Nothing to complain about!,4
"Stayed hear on business, needed a hotel in St Helier as need to get into the town, the hotel is on the hill at the back of the town, it takes 10/15 minutes to walk into the center, just head towards St Johns church and your nearly there Hotel is a good standard, helpful staff with all the facilities you would expect from this level of hotel, good pool, good buffet breakfast with a great choice, rooms nice with a great view over the town, bonus is that they have car parking which can be a luxury in this area, enjoyed my stay and will use again",4
"We love it here. Staff are helpful and friendly. The spa and  gym facilities are first rate. The room is very large and well appointed. I arranged for choclates to be put in my our room as it is our wedding anniversary and arrived to find the choclates,  fruit, flowers and wine. Suprising us both. The bus for the durrel park stops outside on the road and the walk  to town is  just 15 min. Or a bus stops outside. Excellent.   ",5
"The hotel was about a 15 walk from the centre of St Hellier. This didn't cause us a problem but there are buses that stop outside and taxis.  I am so glad we booked this hotel, it was great place to stay. The staff were ALL very friendly, efficient and professional in everything they did. The room was spotlessly clean. The ensuite was again was spotless. Plenty of towels and bathrobes provided.The spa facilities were were second to none, pool, massage pool,steam room, sauna, hot pool plus on site spa treatments and gym. There was also a hairdressers.  Breakfast was as you expect at a quality hotel. I would have liked some ""summer fruit"" berries to go with the yogurt but that is a minor gripe. Dinner was a bit pricey but then St Hellier in general was a bit pricey but the food…",5
"Stayed for 2 nights while attending an event in the hotel and was given a Spa room.  Large room, good bed, blackout blinds, 2 opening huge doors / windows, furnished balcony, town and sea view, full size bath, walk in shower with 2 heads and top quality cosmetics.  Good breakfast choice and standard was high. Excellent friendly and helpful staff.  Large old building with very impressive entrance but a tough walk up from road for those less than fit. 10 minute walk at most from shops and town centre.  Fabulous if expensive Ayusi Spa and a very well equiped gym.  All in all a splendid hotel to stay at when in Jersey, I'd happiliy return when next on the island",5
Beautiful hotel and spa little out of the way from town and steep walk to entrance but if you want to relax in jersey it's ideal has its own first class Asian restaurant several bars the rooms are very spacious only criticism is that breakfast is not all that hot and with the air con it soon becomes cold ,4
Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.     Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.   We had room 140 which overlooked the front of the building.    The spa and pool was excellent and exceptionally well looked after.,4
"Some of the facilities are amazing, the spa and swimming pool area, and I cannot fault the staff. I would love to give it 5 out of 5 but there are a few things that let it down. The hotel was obviously a grand place in the Victorian period, and a lot of the charm remains but the interior is a little dated in places. What is it with having carpet on the lower wall on the second floor? The spa rooms are lovely, in the newer wing. The standard room although pleasant, with an amazingly comfortably bed, was a little dated particularly in the bath room. These are not complaints but observations. They are spending the time to keep the place in order but being such a large hotel it must be like painting the Forth bridge! Free parking on site. Restaurants on site as well although we did…",4
"It's a lovely hotel, we stayed on the second floor in a spa room. Really good views over StHelier, but rooms on lower wouldn't get that. Fantastic breakfast and service. Didn't try the fine dining Indian Restaurant, just a bit too expensive for us. We ate in the Garden room, very nice food and service. Lovely spa, pool gardens and terrace. etc. Courtesy bus to town centre several times a day. You might need this if not very fit or with walking difficulties as hotel is on a very steep slope from the road. Two or three buses stop right outside to town bus station.",4
"I traveled to St Helier with my 24 year old daughter and spent 3 nights at the Hotel de France. Firstly, what a beautiful hotel. The weather, when  we arrived on Saturday afternoon, was glorious and we sat outside on the terrace for a few hours sipping our chilled wine whilst waiting for our relatives to come and meet us.  Our room, on the 5th floor, was spotlessly clean. An array of toiletries were provided which is always a nice bonus. Tea and coffee making facilities were also available in our room. The floor was very quiet and were slept undisturbed during our entire stay.  Breakfast in The Orangery is great. Continental and full cooked breakfasts were included in the price of our stay. Breakfast time was busy, but the staff had no problem whatsoever dealing with the number…",5
The staff and our room we couldn't fault. Our only problem was the only choice in evening to eat is an Indian restaurant which looked nice but if you don't eat or like spicy food your only other choice was a very basic bistro/cafe. So if looking for a good Al A Carte restaurant you have to go out of the hotel to eat. Can certainly recommend a little restaurant called Seven Angels within walking  distance of the hotel the quality of the food and service was absolutely amazing.,3
"Loved our stay here. Everything was first class, the staff, the room, the food and an amazing pool area. Couldn't fault it - would recommend this hotel in a breath, absolutely fantastic.  Freshly cooked kippers in the morning was a bonus !",5
The hotel fulfilled all of our expectations and the facilities were excellent. We especially liked the infinity pool and went swimming every morning. The breakfast was excellent with a good choice. The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Travel was easy using the local bus services and shuttle bus.,5
"Booked early as a treat to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and both our Birthdays. We pointed this out at the time of booking, so we were a little disappointed to discover not at least a bottle of wine  in our room upon arrival. Having said that, everything else was faultless. Staff were amazing, they all worked really hard. Room was clean, spacious and comfy with amazing views over St Helier. Fantastic restaurants within a 15 min walk of the hotel. ",5
"We left the Hotel today after a wonderful Five Day break.   High Praise is due to the staff who were incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our break. They managed to turn a very good Hotel into a magnificent one.  Food was very good at both Breakfast and Evening Meals. We ate in the Garden Dining Room on four of our five nights and  found the food very good. The Menu was varied and well priced, with an excellent special starter and Main Course available each evening. These Specials were a real chance for the Chef to show their skill and imagination. We were thrilled with our decision to try these Specials, very good indeed! Drinks were sensibly priced and good quality.  Our room was clean and comfortable, the spa facilities were excellent and it was a great touch to have…",5
"lovely hotel only a short walk from the town centre, the spa was 10/10. We went to the gym 3 times and found it to be very modern with all the equipment you could ask for.  Great value meals in the garden restuarant especially the steak which was cooked to perfection.   ",5
"Stayed in 2 executive rooms on the 1st & 2nd floor overlooking the beautiful garden at the front and the town of S Helier which is a 15 min walk downhill. Our  large rooms contained kingsize beds, an annex as well as a large bathroom. The furnishings and decor were comfortable and pleasing. The food was amazing, available in two restaurants, either fine dining or bistro style. The breakfast is taken in the glass Orangery covering a wide wonderful selection of food, both continental and hot. The 3 Spa pools were very relaxing containing everything from towels, lockers, showers with soap & shampoo as well as hair and swimming costume dryers. All the staff were polite and very helpful throughout. A truly wonderful place to stay.",5
"Perfect hotel for a relaxing break, excellent spa facilities, friendly staff and 5 star breakfasts. Perfect location for walking into St Helier and also as a base for exploring the island. Hotel is clean and lovely atmosphere.",5
"Stayed at this hotel for the weekend, and I have to say that I can't fault it. The service from the staff was exemplary. The room was very clean and the WIFI is excellent and Free!!!!   The swimming pool and gym are excellent.   I would definitely recommend this hotel should you wish to head to Jersey.",5
"We have just spent 4 nights at the hotel returning this afternoon, our room was cosy to say the least but immaculately clean and well kept for the duration of our stay, the spa facilities were excellent and a real treat for relaxation, breakfast was delicious every morning and the staff are attentive and polite at all times throughout the hotel.   Great location for a short walk into town or take advantage of the free shuttle, relaxed and looking forward to returning as soon as we can, amazing stay!",5
"My wife and I have just come back from the hotel. The hotel was totally spotless. The staff were lovely...Especially Amellie, the Garden View restaurant manager. She was professional, but excellent fun.  The spa was as you would expect, breakfast was of excellent quality. The costs was what you would expect on the island, it's not cheap anymore, nowhere is.  That said the hotel could not have been better.   The hotel is at the back of town, but a cab back from the town was around  £6, so it won't back the bank.  A pint in the hotel was from £4.95 to £6.95  A large rose wine around £5.95.  Dinner for 2 ( main and sweet) with a bottle of wine, around £55. Food was good quality.   All in all, we thought the hotel was a super place to stay. ",5
"The Hotel was very comfortable....I ordered Room Service for Breakfast each morning, which was delicious, especially the scrambled eggs....Afternoon Tea on the Terrace was amazing...with the scones and cream/Jam being the highlight of the experience.....very friendly and helpful staff.....I couldn't fault the Hotel, and will definitely stay again!!",5
"We booked this hotel for our honeymoon and the gift of prosecco and fruit on arrival had us over whelmed. Overall our experience was very good and we enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel was exceptionally clean and suited our needs. ",4
"Booked this hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary , and they didn't disappoint !! Smashing spar facilities,excellent breakfast and nice room and view. Shuttle was a nice touch,being as we did a lot of walking on the five days we stayed. Oh and thanks to the staff, who gave us a bottle of bubbly and a bowl of fruit for our anniversary , - nice touch !!",5
"Just stayed at the Hotel De France, what a great place. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and just happy. The room was superb, the spa one of the best and the food was amazing.  I don't normally leave feedback, but this was exceptional. Thank you to all the staff at the hotel for contributing to our mini break. Mr&Mrs Walters",5
"I love staying at this hotel, I am a jersey resident and have stayed in a few of the islands hotels but the hotel de France is my favourite. I spend my wedding night in this hotel before flying out on honeymoon and there was a bottle of champagne on ice in the room waiting for us, this was a pleasent surprise and a nice touch from the management team. Also the spa and pool facilities are amazing and such a lovely environment to relax.",5
"Chose the Hotel de France from previous reviews, we were not disappointed. Had an Executive Room on the 4th floor. Room had recently been refurbished with new bathroom etc. Only negative comment would be that the 2 armchairs should have been replaced at the same time - we literally sank into them !   Had 3 evening meals and 1 lunch in Garden View restaurant, quality of food was excellent as was price of food and drinks. However drinks in the Lounge Bar were significantly more expensive.  Overall a great stay, friendly staff and we will be back.",5
A good location and staff are very helpful rooms are very spacious and beds are very comfortable  breakfast has a good choice and restaurant's have plenty of choice the spa area  is the best I have ever been too and the gym is good to.,4
"Booked 3 nights at the HDF with our one year old. Hotel was very comfortable, staff were friendly and overall we had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. I would definitely recommend the hotel to others. The only thing missing from the room was a mini bar but it wasn't a show stopper.",4
"I stay here frequently for business. This is a great hotel with excellent staff and good facilities. I always enjoy the welcome from the staff, some of whom remember me between visits, and the reliably comfortable rooms. The food is good and the other facilities (if you have time to use them) are impressive. This is a large, gracious hotel.  I think there is a shuttle bus to the town, although I don't use it. There's plenty of on-site parking. ",5
"This is one of the best hotel we have stayed in years, with all request taken care of and the staff are very attentive and polite with excellent service you could think of. The facilities are awsome as you get to use all spa facilities with your stay and best of all there are excellent restaurants, Bar, fitness gym and spa's in the premises which makes it a clear choice of holiday. Breakfast was full of choices for everyone. Free shuttle service running few times a day to main town centre, but 10-15 min walk do better even which we preferred. The view of whole city with sea and hills from the rooms are great. Also, it full of character inside-out. One of best place to stay for sure.",5
"Food from room service poor. I complained to duty manager in the morning. Mr Alan Andrews. sent first meal back,food not hot, ( Chicken Korma Curry). Second time chicken very tough to eat. Meal cost removed from final bill. This is the first time I have had to complain and I have been staying here since 2011on many occasions. I would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family.",5
"We found the hotel very comfortable, spotlessly clean. Excellent and varied choice for breakfast. We ate in the Garden View restaurant several times and enjoyed it. Location is a little way out of town, not a problem for us but if you prefer not to walk anywhere it wouldn't be ideal - about 20mins to the bars/restaurants/waterfront etc. It did mean we stayed in and ate in the hotel when it rained in the evenings. One downside to the hotel is the smell of curry from Saffron's restaurant which wafts through the whole floor (other floors/room was fine though).",5
"This hotel is situated high up on a hill away from the noisy sea front, the seclusion affording spectacular views and an air of old fashioned romance. We had a view over he roof tops to the sea and hills beyond giving us the peace we craved.",5
"Stayed many times, but had not been for 3 years. Still a lovely place to stay. Stayed in a spa room, this time and love the space, balcony and large bath room, complementary bottle of cava and fruit bowl on arrival, very nice touch. The staff are very nice and friendly, the hotel is still sedate and peaceful, well maintained and spotless. the bar is quite and relaxing. The breakfast has a good choice, we only ate once in the hotel, as when we are on holidays we like to sample different pubs and restaurants. Will be back next year",5
"Nothing to complain about. Room was lovely, had fruit and dressing gown available in my room. All staff were happy and friendly. The spa was amazing, just wish I had more time to enjoy it more. Was able to eat out on the terrace overlooking the gardens.",5
"We stayed in a spa room which was  large and well appointed with comfortable bed . My wife took advantage of the spa and said it was the best she had been in and thought the relaxation room after especially  calming . We enjoyed meals in both the garden restaurant, which had a good menu range , and also Saffrons which was really quite special and not like any meal we have had before really well presented and delicious flavours. This is a lovely Hotel in beautiful grounds within a 10 minute walk of town centre  with helpful and friendly staff always willing to assist and advise .",4
"A great place to stay. Excellent staff, great facilities and lovely food. Its a little walk from the centre of  St Helier but we didn't mind. There are buses, taxis and the hotel has a courtesy shuttle bus to get you where you want to be.",5
Really pleased with my stay at the hotel. the rooms were comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff were responsive to my requests. Excellent service all in all. I would definitely return to this hotel in future,5
"This is our 3rd stay in less than 2-years. The whole atmosphere is one of unhurried efficiency. The staff are brilliant, always ready to help, and always with a smile. We have stayed in all classes of rooms, and the best ones are the Spa Rooms, although the Executive Rooms are also pretty good. We have not eaten in Saffron, but the food and service in The Garden View is perfectly acceptable and not too expensive. We have not tried the Spa, but the pool plus the sauna and steam rooms are still nice to enjoy. Breakfast is very good, with a good choice.  We visit Jersey whenever we can, and The Hotel de France is always our first choice.",5
My previous review of this Hotel said that this is then hotel to stay at while visiting Jersey - i'm not changing this!! The service is still superb; the food and drink wonderful and thankyou for the courtesy bus to the Town centre.,5
First trip to Jersey and the Hotel de France helped to make this a very enjoyable occasion. Lots to see and do on the Island and the Hotel was reasonably central to all of the visits we made. Will definitely visit Jersey again and stay at the Hotel de France.,5
"Booked 2 single rooms and on arrival (after a very delayed flight) we were shown to 2 rooms on the 2nd floor in one wing of the hotel. Sadly, the rooms were very scruffy and tired...definitely not 4star standard. After protesting to the duty manager, we were given other rooms that were freshly decorated with modern furniture and fittings. Had a lovely week but got off to a very disappointing start",4
"Stayed for 3 nights celebrating our golden wedding, having spent our honeymoon there in 1966. Free upgrade, bubbly etc on arrival. Staff perfect no complaints at all. We were in the old part of the hotel as requested,  beautiful room at the front",5
The hotel is excellent and everything was perfect except the buffet breakfast which was very badly  managed and unsupervised.  We would recommend the hotel to family and friends. If the buffet breakfast was improved we would give it 10/10,4
"My husband and I stayed here with our four month old baby for five nights in September. It's a really lovely hotel but really sets it out is the staff - every single person we spoke to was friendly and helpful and all made an effort to interact with our son.   The room was a good size, enough room for a travel cot (provided by the hotel) and all our baby stuff including the pram. Decor is okay but would benefit from an update and a minibar or fridge would have been appreciated. Bed was comfy and linen was really nice so we both slept well (even with a little baby!).   Breakfast was very tasty and there was a good range of items. Most of the food was nice with just the odd thing that didn't quite hit the mark (watery scrambled egg, cold tomatoes..). Service was excellent though…",4
"This was our first trip to Jersey. i booked this hotel because of the reviews and the Spa. I booked a Spa room situated in the newer part of the hotel which i found clean but sparse. Although large it felt badly laid out and the salmon pink  decor did not add to a luxurious feel or a spa feel.  . The bathroom was large  with a walk in shower, and was ok. The Hotel itself is a good 15 minute walk to the beginning of the High Street , but be aware longer coming back as its a steep slope to reach the Hotel. This did prevent us going out again of an evening so the hotels restaurants held us captive. The Spa is lovely but I was disappointed that it didn't offer  manicures and pedicures. There is a beauty salon at the hotel but it appeared to be shut the length of our stay . Breakfast…",4
"A large hotel very classically decorated with lovely helpful staff where nothing is too much trouble.  However on the downside, we felt that the decor was a complete mismatch depending on what area in the hotel you were in as the corridors had carpet on the walls below the dado rail, the breakfast room was something from the 80's but yet the Saffron restaurant and pool/spa area was absolutely beautiful and super modern.  Our bedroom was small but we did have a small Juliet balcony which meant we could have the long French doors open all the time.   The Saffron restaurant was just sublime and although a little pricey the quality of the food and service warranted the cost.    The hotel was further out of town than expected and the walk (with shortcuts) is a good 15 mins.  We…",4
"I have had to travel to Jersey on and off for the last 18 months and each time I have visited the service has been excellent.  Staff are friendly, helpful and always make me feel welcome.  I like a room with a desk where I can work and the hotel always ensures I have this. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is excellent and something for everyone. The food is good, bar relaxing and the spa facilities are the best I have experienced. I am looking forward to my trip next month having only just returned from another great stay.",5
"Our room was a bit tired; small but just adequate; absolutely NO drawer space for underwear, etc;  bad lighting; no minibar (we were offered a fridge but refused due to lack of space); bathroom small and again no storage; only over bath shower but a good one. Spa excellent but rather disappointed with the treatments.  We each had one and thought they were over-priced;  have had better massages elsewhere.",5
"Booked this via Expedia and after doing so, friends said it is one of the best hotels in the island.   That would be true. From my experience, such hotels have a great facade and reception but are tatty behind the scenes ie rooms. This was superb. We had a balcony room in the newer part of the hotel. Really clean and pleasant. The staff were all helpful and pleasant.   Breakfast was self service and there was a good variety on offer. The pool area was good also.   Restaurants on site a bit limited and expensive. We opted out of going to saffron, the Indian based one, as we saw reviews that said a meal for two would be north of £100, for a fancy curry?   Garden restaurant was nice but a bit limited regarding the menu.   Overall a great place to stay, about 15 mins walk. ",5
"Stayed in huge bedroom really comfy, lovely service, friendly staff. Beautiful lamb shank with prompt service. Quiet and comfy didn't notice any loud bangs . Large bathroom with hot shower and fluffy towels . Only point was no view, looked out onto boiler house , pipes etc , was that because I was on business?, would have been nice to see the sea",4
The best bit of the hotel is the fantastic spa facilities. The rooms are clean & comfortable but the décor throughout the hotel is a little dated. It's a short walk from the hotel into the centre of St Helier but we enjoyed exploring the beautiful island in our hire car rather than spending time there. ,4
"Excellent stay. The place is gorgeous, very quiet and close to the city center (10' walk). The staff is professional and very nice all the time. Breakfast is great. Great to use the spa after touring the island. Really appreciated having a drink or dining in the Garden View Restaurant at any time of the day, the people in charge do their best to make it enjoyable.",5
"This is a confusing hotel. The original hotel remains traditional, while the extension is designed in a modernist style that creates a jarring contrast. The spa rooms are spacious, but the space is poorly used. The bed, while comfortable, is placed at a strange angle, which gives a good view of the town but a poor view of the TV. The bathroom has a large bath, but a shower with only an overhead shower head, which is inconvenient if you don't want to wash your hair. There is little room to place products, and the mirror is bad for shaving or makeup. The (unheated) towel rail is too small for the towels, so one is left with damp towels. The bedroom has no curtains, only blinds, so the black-out is poor and rain beating against the windows can be noisy, without curtains to suppress…",3
"Travelling all around the world and staying in a wide variety of hotels, I would definitely recommend a stay at the hotel de france. Staff were very friendly and helpful, the food excellent and hotel in a convenient but quiet location.",5
"I generally stay at the Hotel de France for business purposes but my wife occasionally accompanies me.  Neither of us has any complaints.  The service is excellent both in reception and the various restaurants.  Rooms are large enough to allow space for working in the evening, if required.  There are plenty of spaces around the hotel for quiet reading if your other half is working.  The location of the hotel is in an older part of town, away from the glossier harbour developments.  Personally I prefer this because it is quieter in the evenings and you are less likely to encounter the more stereotypically noisy holiday crowds.  It is maybe a 10 minute walk to the town centre if you don't fancy the courtesy bus.  I really like the place and am always disappointed if my employers…",5
"Hotel had listened and responded to my requests. Spa excellent, gardens excellent, and staff superb. Only issues, a little far out of town, and breakfast ,although good quality food, was a little bit too much self service and school hall type room. Garden restaurant excellent.",4
Great hotel we arrived from Edinburgh for the weekend to attent horseracing and had a great time....everything teriffic except windows only opened a little and no a/c so too hot ....nevertheless a great hotel and a great weekend !!,5
Could not wish for any better we have been staying at the same hotel for 12 years and are now in the process of booking again the spa is fantastic the Lounge bar and its staff are second to none Saffrons restaurant is one of the best restaurants in Jersey and the staff and manager running it are first class all over a wonderful experience.,5
Smart hotel with great spa facilities in St Helier. The Saffron restaurant was good. The food was Indian based but very original and yummy! Would go back as a lovely place to relax with nearby scenic beaches.,4
You will need a mortgage to eat at the hotel's iindian restaurant! Lovely spa though! In the steam room you can all gather around and worship a lump of kryptonite!! Staff all very friendly and the Hotel itself looks amazing!,4
"We have to agree with other reviewers that the Staff are fantastic.  We had paid for a room with a balcony and it was large, modern and we were very comfortable there for a week.  The only problem was the glass lift to our wing on the second floor was causing problems so we had to use the main hotel lift where we felt safer.   We ate in both restaurants and they were good.  However we like to eat at different restaurants and the 15 minute walk back into town at night, after spending the day walking the coastal walk, sometimes proved a challenge.  Next time as a holiday venue we would choose one of the beautiful Bays around Jersey.",4
"Lovely hotel, staff very good. Kept running out of food and juice at breakfast. Spa amazing, best to pre book treatments before you arrive, and pool a real added bonus. I'd definately visit again. Indian restaurant served fantastic food.",4
Been to Hotel De France for the last 11 years and always the rooms are well prepared and spotless The Shuttle bus is also very good to drop you into town.We stayed in the spa rooms this year it was excellent as the extra storage space and the excellent bathroom and mini bar/fridge.,4
We stayed for 3 nights 2 on business 1 I booked for extra night with my wife  The 1st 2 nights I stayed in a double room which was comfortable clean tidy  The 3 red night my wife was there I payed to go in a spar room with balcony  This overlooked the roof of the swimming pool the room was much bigger  Don't get room 106 it is a disable room  Not worth paying extra for room  We enjoyed stay  Finally the breakfast on morning of my original 2 night stay was cold the final breakfast what a change really hot,3
We've just had the best time staying 3 nights st this hotel .  The staff are amazing so helpful.  Nothing is to much trouble.  We've eaten all 3 nights in the garden Resturant .  OMG delicious and really reasonable prices . Defiantly recommend the hotel and Resturant 😀,5
"excellent hotel....5/5 cleaniness ,service,facilities,staff ,room....shuttle bus to and from own...spa lovely and very clean.......Staff very well trained and professional nothing to much bother...will defo go back",5
Really enjoyed my stay at the de France. Staff and room nice no luxury in our room but very clean and comfy beds. Spa area and outside space fabulous. Our room had a view of an old tin roof which had lots of funnels emitting numerous noises. So because of the Rubbish view I really cannot give this a five star rating. Enjoyed breakfast and the few meals we ate in the hotel were very nice.👍🏼👌🏼,4
A first rate place. Staff are great. Lovely spa and gardens. A little out of the town but never an issue as hotel has own shuttle.  Would fully recommend. You won't regret a visit. Very clean and full of character. .,4
Stayed here for 5 nights with friends. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the town centre. The hotel has a free shuttle but we didn't use this as we like to walk. The rooms were absolutely spotless with comfortable beds and tea and coffee making facilities. The corridors were wide and all the common areas were attractive and well looked after. The breakfast buffet was excellent and catered for just about every European taste. We ate in both of the hotels 2 restaurants and the food was excellent every time. Saffrons restaurant serves fine dining Indian cuisine and I have to say that it was some of the best food I have ever tasted. We had the 3 course set menu with a choice of 4 or 5 things for each course. It cost £40 each and 4 eat for the price of 3. It was worth every…,5
"Everything was first class.  Special mention and thanks to Costus, the waiter, who made our holiday truly memorable.  We will definitely return.  The fact that it was Battle of Britain and the pilots were staying in the hotel was a bonus!",5
"One way system around St.Helier proved very challenging to find the hotel. Facilities good. Pool excellent. Would probably stay out of St Helier next time, the other bays around the island are so pretty.",4
"This hotel was fab.  We booked a Spa room, as they looked more modern.  It was quite pricey at £184 per night, but the room, breakfast (included), bathroom, gardens and Spa facilities were well worth the price.  We also found some great restaurants nearby (use Trip Advisor) and the stroll into town wasn't too far.  We will definitely be returning!  Very happy. ",5
I love staying here ! The Staff are very welcoming .The food is good and the guest areas are nice very spacious .The standard rooms are ok .the terrace is Lovley on a warm evening .Hope to visit soon 😀,4
"This was. a special birthday surprise for my wife that she will never forget. the Hotel is beautiful and the staff are so friendly and keen to please. The spa experience was the best I have had, the pool so clean and no smell of chlorine.",5
"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel de France for five days in September. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and were given complementary prosecco, fruit and flowers. The staff in all areas were friendly and helpful. We ate at both restaurants and the food was very good, particularly at Saffrons. Really couldn't fault it!",5
My wife and I had a very enjoyable three night stay at this hotel. The service was excellent and the rooms very spacious and clean. I would certainly recommend both a visit to the Spa for one of their wonderful treatments and a dinner in Saffron which was particularly special.,5
A great hotel.  Staff are wonderful and breakfast great.  Spa is a welcome addition and very friendly.  I would recommend this hotel but for those not to good on their pins it is up a steep hill. You can imagine this would have been a splendid property back in the day.,4
"Two nights spent in this hotel was enough to suggest that more nights would definitely be a very nice treat. The rooms are very nice and clean, beds are extremely comfortable and the large TV and tea making facilities make for a pleasant stay. Reception staff are very eager to please and the reception area is quite luxuriousand spacious. I never used the pool or spa facilities but again this looked a treat for the resident. The garden view bar and restaurant area was a little busy but staff were very attentive and speedy. I really wanted to sample the main restaurant and its indian based tasting menu but it was at least £40 over my budget, unfortunately. Breakfast was a very nice experience, good service and masses of choice. WIFi is automatic - the best i have experienced in…",4
"Hotel very clean , rooms very comfortable  / Staff very professional , wanting to attend your every need and couldn't do enough for you  / food brilliant and at a very reasonable price and good choice  / facilities all absolutely brilliant . ",5
"Lovely twin bedded room overlooking St. Helier and the sea. Lovely building overlooking beautiful gardens with excellent spa, gym, and pools. Food was good and staff were very friendly and efficient. A great selection of hot and cold food for breakfast.",5
Beautiful hotel would visit again spa was the best I have been to. Food was lovely just wished they had a medium wine as all the wines were dry.  Lovely cocktails thou🙂 Room was a lovely size also it had a balcony.,5
"Excellent staff, very helpful, nothing a problem. Food was tasteful and well presented. Breakfast had everything I would want. Very clean and smart hotel. The pool, steam room and sauna were great to use with towels provided.",5
I've stayed here on business many times over 16 years and had my family with me many times also.  Lots to do in the hotel what with the spa and restaurants and a five minute walk to the centre of jersey. Fantastic ,5
Lovely hotel good staff wished shuttle bus ran longer into the evening The resturant food was very good and afternoon tea. Rooms were comfortable wished the double bed had been bigger.pool area and gardens were excellent too,5
I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this one rates with the best. Bedroom very clean and really comfortable bed. Spa and pool facilities top notch. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfasts had everything you could wish for including gluten free bread. Reception staff were very helpful and assisted us greatly on our arrival and throughout our stay.,5
"Stayed for 12 days. Very relaxing, excellent spa, swimming pool and beauty salon. Food excellent, nothing too much trouble. WiFi good coverage. 15 mins to Ferry port, 10 to central St Helier. Free parking at hotel, local Coop Dept store and Waitrose Supermarket. Can reach anywhere on the island within 25 mins. Will return next year.",5
"Went here for a few days as a treat with my Husband, Sister and Brother in law.  This Hotel is so lovely. All the staff are friendly. The restaurant is priced  well considering the 4*s. The spa too is faultless. Temperature just right.  The rooms are clean. Free safe and tea making facilities.  A 15 min walk to the main town. I could have stayed there all week. The food is good. The only thing I might say wasn't so good , was having a room directly in front of the lifts. Luckily I had my ear plugs because you could here the ding dong of the doors opening,  but I wasn't going to give it less than 5 stars because of that. Will definitely go back. ",5
The room is exceptional. The food is exceptional. The staff are exceptional. The hotel is exceptional full stop. Anyone who can moan about this place doesn't know what luxury is. Definitely best hotel on the island. If i could give it more than a 5 rating I would...,5
"The hotel is a little out of town, about 25 minutes walk from St Helier centre. The courtesy bus into town is useful but infrequent and doesn't pick up returns. Taxis cost around £6 per trip. Great breakfast selection, beautiful spa/pool area. Rooms are small but very clean and well serviced. Windows are small, restricting the view, no balconies which was disappointing. Restaurant has a menu which is the same every day, lunch and dinner so can be rather monotonous. The on-site Saffron Indian restaurant is incredibly expensive. The gym is well equipped, but hotel residents are not allowed to use much of the equipment which is for gym members only. There is no evening entertainment or facilities so most people tend to go into St Helier for the evening. It is a beautiful hotel and…",4
Had a wonderful weekend away in jersey to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Hotel de France were very accommodating with very helpful staff. We had a little gift package in our room from the hotel (in photos) to help us celebrate. The spa facilities were very relaxing. ,5
"Location at the back of town . A short 15 minuet walk to the center of town. Facilities are good , staff very helpful  Our room was nice but had no air con not great when the temperature is 25c + The sun terrace and breakfast almost made up for that.",4
"I was in a party of 3 couples visiting Jersey for a long weekend. After reading reviews of this hotel, we decided to stay here and we were not disappointed. We had 3 adjacent rooms on the fifth floor which had good views over the town and out to sea. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. Plenty of storage and a good sized comfortable bed. The en-suite bathroom was also a good size and well equipped. The included breakfast was extremely good and the waiting staff were all very helpful. Easy access to town and beyond with good parking facilities tops off this excellent hotel. Highly recommended.",5
"Excellent breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff, very large room which was decorated beautifully. The spa and pools were amazing.  Catered brilliantly for children. Big bonus was the free parking and even in the height of summer we did not struggle to get a space. The only criticism and it is an extremely small one was the lack of fridge in the room though I dare say that if I had of asked then one would have been provided.  The restaurants were excellent quality, again catering for children and were reasonably priced.",5
Excellent stay. Hotel staff welcoming and informative. Our room was on the corner which had a double aspect over the town. Impressed with the room and decor. Amenities wer excellent too.thanks very much,5
"A great hotel with friendly staff and fantastic amenities. It's a short walk from the town centre, where they are plenty of shops and bars. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back.                                                                                   ",4
"I have stayed at the Hotel de France many times and always leave feeling totally relaxed - the reception team was helpful and friendly, our room was spacious and comfortable, we loved spending time in the spa before breakfast and give full marks to the breakfast team who were incredibly busy but kept cool, calm and collected.",5
"The good bits; Hotel pools and health suite area is absolutely fantastic and definitely the best I have ever been to.  Location is convenient as is parking on site.  The only thing that really let down my stay was the fact that the bath was slightly damaged (room 412) and a botched repair had been carried out. Also I was surprised that there was no mini fridge in the room, although staff were helpful in providing ice buckets to cool the champagne.  I certainly would stay again and the issues were only minor but they are the reason that I can't give it a full five",4
"Truly magnificent hotel, from the moment you walk in to reception, greeted extremely well. All questions were answered professionally. The room was clean, bright, with all amenities at hand. Spa is to be experienced personally, best one on the island for me. Dinner food was superb and great value, the staff couldn't do enough for you, was great to see a waitress without a device, pen and paper being used to take our order. Refreshing to see and experience, great memory. Fantastic atmosphere, and cocktails to finish of the evening. Buffet style breakfast, one I'm always not convinced of, the standard and selection of food was more than I could have imagined. 1010",5
"Lovely, well equipped room in new part of hotel. Opted for the taster menu in Saffrons which was delicious with great accompanying wines. Breakfast was delicious; everything from fruit, yogurt, juices thru to items cooked to order. The pool facilities were excellent, and the outdoor restaurant was great for lunch.",5
"A little way out of St Helier itself, but a nice hotel with a fabulous restaurant and good spa facilities.  Wonderfully equipped and well styled rooms. Breakfast a little disappointing, and pricey given its location out of town",4
"On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with warm and welcoming staff, nothing was too much trouble  We were shown to our fabulous room which was very comfortable, spacious and extremely well designed the bathroom was huge and luxurious too Meals in the Garden Terrace were very good value for money and tasty. The staff are very friendly but professional All in all a great place too stay ",5
You couldn't better the hotel the rooms & public areas were spotless. The reception staff were lovely & made us feel very welcome as soon as we walked In. The pool area was very good plus it was very nice having sun loungers in the garden,5
"From the moment that you check in, you are made to feel special, the staff are friendly, efficient, the room we stayed in was spacious, this was our 5th visit in the past 2 years, hopefully we'll be visiting again in the very near future ",5
"My wife and I spent four nights at this super hotel. We were in Jersey on business but stayed on at the hotel to take advantage of all it had to offer. Where to start with our praise? The staff were friendly and extremely helpful; our room was clean, well appointed and serviced; the food was good; the Spa and pool were wonderful. My only complaint - and not the hotel's fault - was the number of guests who thought it acceptable to use their mobile phones at the tops of their voices in all the public rooms!",5
"Hotel was ok, but we ha adjoining room which mean we heard everything our neighbours were saying; including the banging frequently of their wardrobe door. However, there was one thing t breakfast which was quite annoying and irritating, one young woman who was a waitress called Nicola would lay the cutlery each morning. As he laid them she would lick her fingers as she touched each serviette/napkin as well as the cutlery. This is quite deplorable. In addition her hair was constantly hanging in the way as she removed our plates. I think this level of poor hygiene is not acceptable for such a fine hotel.  Apart from this moan our stay was nice especially using the spa. Spa was excellent!! There was some young boys under 16, in there after 6:30 pm which I understand is against the…",3
"As our trip was short notice we could'nt get into our usual 5* hotel that we stay in and I read the reviews on tripadvisor and thought it sounded ok....OMG from the moment we checked into our room we realised what a massive mistake that we had made, we had a very old room an Executive Suite well all the furniture needed to be put on a bonfire and it was a very hot day and the air-con in our room did'nt work. We managed to move into a Spa Room well that was just as bad, the service in the Hotel was dreadful when you order ANYTHING you have to wait a very very long time to get anything.  So with all the stress of having to stay in this hotel as all hotels on the Island were fully booked , we thought we would get a Spa treatment as this was suppose to be a good Spa ? OMG it was the…",2
We used the Hotel de France in St Helier when in Jersey celebrating our sons wedding. We checked in on a very hot day and found the room to be uncomfortably hot! When we complained the staff could not do enough for us. They upgraded us to a larger cooler suite! On the morning of the wedding we had two potential disasters! Our grandson banged his head in the swimming pool and was left with a slight gash which bled a lot! Once again the staff calmly assisted us by running my grandson and his dad to the hospital and then returning them in plenty of time for the wedding. It was then my daughters dress zip broke making it unwearable! We asked for help and once again they assisted us by providing a seamstress to sow my daughter into her dress. In fact all through the week we stayed at…,5
"The spa is top and also the fantastic and plentiful breakfast buffet. The hotel area is very apppealing. The rooms are a bit small but nice. The people at the front desk are very polite and friendly, but the service at the lounge and in the restaurant was not particulary good. The staff is partially pretty inattentive and overwhelmed. The food in the resataurant could be better. ",4
"Little to say except that food, accommodation, facilities and staff - especially the staff, are of a very high standard It is out of the town but convenient. We felt at ease every minute. Try the cocktails - the guys are special.",5
Stayed for 5 nights in an spa room with balcony. Expensive but lovely room and spa very good although didn't have any treatments as they were very pricey!  The garden restaurant was lovely and steak definitely the best we ate in jersey. Good breakfast and generally great hotel. Bit of a walk to the town but there was a shuttle bus. Would definitely return and recommend ,5
"My partner brought me here for my birthday, as I used to travel to Jersey as a child with my family.  I always used to stay at the beach so this was my first time staying in the town of St Helier.  The hotel itself is lovely.  The room we had was huge with a Jacuzzi bath.  Bed was very comfortable.  Lots of choice for breakfast.  The spa and gym are of a very high standard.  There is an undercover car park for hotel guests, which was really useful as we hired a car.  I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Hotel de France is very good, but we had to move from standard room to junior suite for third night as hotel fully booked.   Junior suite (room 318) is not worth an extra £40 per night.  The junior suite bathroom had no flat surfaces to store items and the wardrobe was in the wrong place and difficult to access.   Standard room far better in both respects.",4
"You really need to be sure to get a good room, some are pretty tired.  The hotel staff are incredibly helpful and very friendly. Breakfast was very comprehensive and fresh and tasty. The afternoon tea in the terrace bar was delicious  Lovely spa too.",4
We really enjoyed our stay here for 2 nights. The pool and garden area is stunning with plenty of sunbeds available. Our room was clean and modern with all the facilities we needed. Breakfast was excellent and staff attentive at all times. It's a short walk to town but the free bus service to town is great and takes you to the bus station where you can go anywhere on the island for £2. We had a very enjoyable stay.,5
"Hotel good ,spa pool great room a biit pokey  for 100 pounds a night ,normally get a bigger bed in other hotels breakfast not up to pomme or dor or the Royal yacht but did the job. Poll was great  steam room and sauna.",3
"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff. Island is steeped in so much history with lots to see and do. Visits to the scenic and historical sites are a must. First week of August is Battle of Flowers week with amazing decorated floats ",5
"This is a lovely hotel to stay the standard room was very comfortable and clean, all linen was changed every day.  We happened to be there when the weather wasn`t too great part of the time and we were cold in the room, the windows were draughty which was not very good when you sitting around.  The breakfast was great, anything you could wish for but we did have one or two hiccups with the evening meal, forgetting a starter and some meat which was rather tough, which the staff sorted out.  The hotel is quite a way from the harbour but there is a shuttle bus every day down there but you have to make your own way back up the hill, walk, service bus or taxi.  We were so busy sight seeing that we didn`t have time to use the spa facilities etc. which apparently are great.",4
.everything about hotel was very average. Room as well as being noisy was quite small and husband and I had to keep moving out of each others way. Also if your not fit beware of the steep hill you have to climb from road to hotel entrance. ,3
"My brother myself and our wife,s visited this hotel on the 15th August for four days.  We were most impressed with the easy check in.  Our rooms which were on suite overlooked the gardens, the room was pleasant with tea/coffee making.  As the weather was very warm during our stay the air conditioning was most welcome.  The beds were very comfortable.  Taking all into consideration we enjoyed our stay.  All staff were friendly and very efficient. The free WiFi throughout the hotel was the best i have come across, with strong signal. The pool in the hotel was like a warm bath, fantastic",5
"Good hotel, Spa & breakfast (except salmon which is very fat...)  Location within 15 minutes walk from city center, but the hotel offres the possibility to drive you to the center by mini bus.  Staff very Nice & professionnal.  Prices à little too high I believe. ",4
Fantastic Hotel Comfortable and clean. Pool facilites exceptional. Breakfast and Saffron restaurant choice of foods first class. Bus shuttle service to town centre was useful bonus. Room decor first class.,5
Enjoyed a lovely garden view whilst enjoying a delicious afternoon tea.  The scones were wonderfully light texture and jersey cream to accompany them superb. Good selection of sandwiches & cakes. Would definitely recommend.,4
"We only stayed a few nights at the Hotel de France, but were charmed by its comfortable, friendly and refined atmosphere.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and of good quality and the staff were always very friendly and attentive.  Our favourite place for a few drinks in the evening was the lovely terrace overlooking the garden.  We will definitely be back on our next visit.  ",5
Fantastic hotel. Most comfortable beds ever. Everything about the hotel was perfect. Couldn't fault it in any way. This was our first visit to Jersey and Would love to come back very soon. This hotel making all the more special.,5
"The room was very nice with a good view, and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was a slight disappointment, being a buffet style, the full English, was not always hot or fresh enough, but nothing too drastic. We ate in the hotel most evenings and the menu and food was very good, no problem there. The outstanding feature of this hotel was the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, couldn't have been better.",4
"great staff, facilities and spa is a must visit. over all stay - brilliant and I would stay here again in the future. The hotel is defo worth considering if looking for meeting rooms or private dinning areas for business use. Large hotel with great views over looking Jersey and stunning gardens. ",5
"I stayed in the executive suite, wonderful clean, bathroom we amazing. The staff throughout the whole hotel were wonderful and friendly, cant fault them they worked hard all of the time. Hotel was clean, the food in the hotel restaurant was of a top quality. !0 minutes from St. Helier town cnetre, bus stop outside if you want the bus, WiFi in the room, Tv was a little on the small side though we didnt go on hols to watch Tv a larger Tv would have been good. There is a bus laid on by the hotel to take people into town if walking is difficult. Guests have free access to the acqua spa, excellent swimming pool and gym, once again the staff were approachable and friendly. There was a mixture of guests in the hotel from familys to couples both old and young. TOP Hotel!",5
"Great hotel and staff, and superb pool area. You could spend all day in there. Breakfast v good. Hotel staff always helping. Spa treatments are must, but a bit pricey. All staff were very friendly and accommodating. ",5
"We came for a family wedding, and welcomed the advice given about getting to St Helier Parish Church in the maze of one-way streets.   Please look at the wardrobes in rooms such as 261:  I could not hang my knee length coat, nor several other items in the wardrobe.  I had to use  the back of a door, from which they slipped often.",5
"What can I say,perfect location,wonderful food,exceptional staff,breakfast the best start of the day after such a sound sleep on a superbly comfortable bed...now if I have to make a criticism would be the handle on the toilet cistern...stiff",5
Fabulous hotel rooms in desperate need of updating. Family room we normally have which are great but we found the double room small and old fashioned. The shower in the bath is also very dated. Hotel staff are very helpful .,3
"What makes this hotel is the staff, they were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help you.  Although the hotel is very dated in its decor it has huge amounts of character and is very clean everywhere.   The spa looks new and is really lovely, well worth making the time to go if you're staying at the hotel, although treatments are expensive. The drinks in the bar(s) are very expensive and the terrace bar area let itself down where tables weren't cleared away for hours, lack of staff attending to guests on the terrace and ashtrays over flowing. The staff in the Saffron Bar were very attentive and professional, something you don't see so often anymore. The hotel is a 15/20min walk from town and the hotel is at the top of a hill, something less nimble people might want to be…",3
"Great Hotel, the staff are what really make a hotel and the staff are 1st class, professional but also approachable. I stay at this hotel 4 to 5 times a year and have nothing but praise for the staff from reception to catering to the staff that take care of the rooms, nothing is to much trouble for the guests. ",5
"This was our third visit to the De France. The evening dining in the Orangery has now stopped. We ate three times at the Garden View. Twice it was dear but tasty and fresh but the third time our food was inedible. A waiter asked if all was ok and we said no. Nothing was done. We complained to the hotel reception and the money was refunded.   Our room was very small on arrival and we were moved the next day to a far better room (512), which had garden and sea views. The pool area and garden is beautiful.   We at last dined at the Saffron Lounge restaurant. Excellent food and service but pricey. The breakfast was ok. Good tea service etc and a lot of choice, however, there were no bread rolls and the smoked salmon and Parma ham was rather dried up.   The room cleaners were…",3
"Stay at Hotel De France from 1st to 8th August with my husband, we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, having honeymoon in jersey back then too ( different hotel). We were not disappointed on returning, Jersey is a beautiful place, with lots to see and do. Hotel was first class. We had a front facing room which over looked the lovely gardens and terrace and had a lovely view over St Helier. Breakfast was really good, ran very efficiently. Staff were nice and friendly, always willing to help. Spa was lovely and relaxing and great to come back to after a busy day exploring Jersey. Would recommend Hotel de France, and will definitely be back.",5
Yet another comfortable and hassle free stay at the Hotel de France. My room at the back had air conditioning. Great for hot weather! Whilst they only had g/f rolls we have arranged a system so they can in g/f bread for me. Definitely going the extra mile :),5
Each member of the staff has contributed to our relax. The spa did also help when the sun was shy. Gorgeous breakfast and very silent room. The town center was very near on foot. On the island you never get bored. We were very sad to return back to London.,5
"The hotel is very impressive and once past the facade it continues to impress. The rooms are well furnished, spotlessly clean and spacious. Breakfast has a great choice, all continuously replenished and consistent high quality. The lunch and evening meals in the restaurant are good and reasonably priced. Being able to eat outside on the terraces is a bonus. The spa feels new as its so clean with acres of marble. The variety of hot, cold, massage and vernal pool also make this a high quality place to relax both inside or outside in the immaculately kept gardens. Parking is free and in front of the hotel. A short walk into St Helier too is max 15 mins so perfectly located too. No hesitation on recommending the hotel to anyone.",5
"The staff were brilliant. I dropped my glasses off the balcony (yep, stupid thing to do!) 2nd floor, within 10 minutes of checking in! The lovely staff retrieved my glasses, popped the lense back in and delivered them to our room. ",5
"We are local. My wife is a member of the superb fitness centre, which is expensive, but worth it. Being a member allows access to the hotel facilities, so we decided tonight that I would join her after her swim for dinner. The weather is rather nice at present.  I confess I do not know whether the restaurant is usually open to non residents, but I assume so. As the weather is so good they had a barbecue. Top of the menus was mackerel fillet with jersey royals for £14.95. I never have mackerel at home, so find it hard to pass up when I see it on the menu. The wife ordered steak and a side salad. After 35 minutes we asked where the food was. The waitress went to ask, and said that it was just being plated up and would be 20 seconds. A good five minutes later, the food arrived. We…",2
"It was our 5th anniversary and we couldn't choose a better place to stay, beautifull all around, the spa facilities really did the job and the massage was as they said, just amazing!! Would recommend to anyone!  Thank you",5
"Stayed in a spa bedroom.  Bedroom size was more than adequate.  Bed comfortable. Lovely views across st helier town and far reaching sea views. Nice bathroom, the only small criticism are the sink taps! Badly designed and almost  impossible to turn off with slippery wet hands!  The hotel is clean and well kept, but slightly dated.  1980's throw back on the colours in the corridors, but I am being picky ! The reason myself and my husband have  returned to this hotel on many occasions is the spa.  The treatments are fabulous, the pool area is a lovely size - no fighting for loungers, which is lovely if you want to spend the day chilling  reading, sleeping, relaxing. The sun was shining when we were there so we stayed outside sunbathing all day, again plenty of loungers to choose…",4
"Our second stay  here. Our front facing room was a little small but very clean and recently decorated, modern decor with a flat screen tv. WIfI although not important to us was fine.  Food was excellent. The Orangery was light and airy for breakfast which was plentiful and constantly refilled. We had several  meals in Garden View Restaurant which were very good with a reasonable choice and not overly expensive.  Finally, without exception the staff were friendly, understanding and always willing to help. We would certainly stay here again.",5
"I booked 6 rooms for this hotel for a friends surprise birthday weekend, everone in the group loved the hotel and location, check in took less than 5 mins all staff very helpful rooms were great and breakfast bus buffet style but you can always order egges how you prefer. Town is a 10 minute walk, spent Saturday morning around the harbour which is lovely and went along to St Albans next town along the coast in afternoon lovely village with a few great pubs and restuarants on sea front to sit outside. lovely fishing town. Taxi's are very reasonable and very helpful, im sure we will all be returning.",5
"A good experience. Nice room overlooking St Helier, good wi-fi which worked well. Lovely garden with terrace, bar etc and great spa and pool. Staff friendly and welcoming. One slight downer was the patchy service in the (quite pricey) Garden View Restaurant. Eat there 4 times, twice it was very good and twice the service was slow. (45 minute wait for main course) but we were given free drinks to compensate. Many other good (and reasonably priced) eating places 10 minute walk into town. Overall well done, would stay again.",4
"Arrived on a long weekend break. Friendly helpful and attentive staff, very enjoyable stay, made to feel welcome  Great facilities spacious surroundings. Short walk to the town centre or take the courtesy bus with a choice of two drop off points to position you where you need to be.   Definitely will return, thank you Hotel de France",5
"Recommend to others Enjoyed staying there Definitely would stay again The spa is perfect, especially the massage The jacuzzi water could of beeen a bit warmer The food at the restaurant was very good and fulfilling  ",5
"Stayed for 4 nights for a family get together. Imposing frontage, beautiful lawns and very welcoming terrace with outside bar and service.It is a 10 -15 minute walk to town but the hotel does shuttle buses. our room ( executive room )  was nice and spacious but had no mini bar.Bathroom was spacious. the hotel has a brasserie and formal dining restaurant. The lounge with bar is welcoming and not overly pricey. Breakfast room ( comprehensive choice ) is light and airy and the service is 1st class. You are quickly showed to your table and dirty dishs are removed promptly. The thing is like about this hotel is the service....everyone made you feel welcome with a smile on their face and wih excellent assistance as well. A small outside pool would be nice, but the spa and facilities…",5
"Stayed here for two nights with my family and enjoyed my stay here. The room was adequate and up to standard. We had a bathroom however when we ran a bath the water came out quite slow! Not a problem though.  The beds were so comfortable I've never stayed in a hotel with beds as comfortable as these!   We had bed and breakfast and there was a wide selection for breakfast ranging from croissants and cereal to fruit to a full English breakfast which was very well made.   The location was good however it is a steep walk up a hill to get back to the hotel - a short walk but if you are old it could be a bit tiring.  The hotel staff were all very nice and answered any questions we had and helped us very quickly - they provided us with an ironing board and iron when needed, and very…",4
"Lovely hotel,  friendly staff and food excellent,  we ate in all the restaurants in the hotel,  my only complaint was a  small fridge in the room would of been good. Also if you are not fit it is a climb up to the hotel if you are walking. A very enjoyable return visit to Jersey though",4
"Pool and garden and especially car parking big pluses for this charming hotel in St Helier. Only negative feature was the decor in the Orangery dining room seemed a little dated. One minor criticism, pieces of fruit in salad too big. ",4
Super hotel with an old fashioned charm mixed with a more modern spa. Immaculately clean throughout. Great food and friendly attentive staff. Loved every minute. My only wish would be air conditioning in the rooms; there was a standalone unit but these do not work as efficiently as integral systems and the rooms did get very hot - we were there in the 35 degree heat (I'm not complaining though - it was simply glorious by the pool and the gardens!!). We've stayed here twice now and will definitely be back. ,5
"We stayed for a week at hotel de France and the staff were all so kind, helpful and accommodating. It's a fair walk into town but 3 of the islands buses stop outside. If you want to head West you need to head into town first. The spa was the absolute highlight, might be worth booking in advance at busy times as we almost couldn't get in for treatments which would have been really disappointing.  Loved all of the restaurants,  saffrons is more pricey but we'll worth it. Would highly recommend to others who are happy to walk or spend money on bus/taxis. There is a shuttle bus to town but it wasn't really explained to us by reception staff so we caught on very late to this.",4
"The hotel has everything, its smart, has friendly staff, delicious food, fabulous spa with lovely treatments, pretty gardens. daily shuttle to St.Helier. not too far from town.  The best part of my break is the treatments, they have helped my health,with relieving stress and relaxing.  lovely ",5
We had 2 adjacent rooms to accommodate our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 teenagers) and both rooms were of an adequate size and clean and in good condition.  One of the hairdryers was slightly damaged and a kettle had to be replaced as it leaked but this was done without fuss. Slightly surprised that there wasn't a fridge but there was a room safe.  The rooms were a bit cold - we were there in a cool week in August and the heating was off but fans were available if the weather had warmed up. We were relieved that we had only booked B&B as the menu in the Garden Room restaurant seemed to be fixed for the season and was quite limited and despite checking when booking the evening restaurant staff were not particularly helpful with food allergies and there was very little that was…,4
We had a weeks stay in a Junior Suite  and  our daughter stayed in a single room .The suite had a great view over the top of the town to the sea and the comfort of having a comfortable seating area made the extra price worth paying.  The decor was a bit dated but furnishings were in excellent condition and room kept spotless throughout our stay.  The bed was a sleigh bed so very low and we found it not very comfortable but that is our taste so others may find it ok.  The single room was also great it looked like it had been recently decorated in more modern colours than the suite and nice runner on bed etc.  My daughter said the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were always friendly and although we didn't eat much at the hotel what we had in the garden restaurant…,4
There was no air conditioning in our room and the bathroom extractor fan was poor which meant a sweaty experience! Other than that a very nice hotel with all the staff being very helpful and pleasant. ,5
"Everything about our stay here was fabulous , Saffron restaurant , Lounge bar, Terrace bar, gardens are emaculate, the pools are great, rooms , bathroom good, only thing not 10 is the buffet breakfast, but that is me , I don't like them sorry",5
Good alround hotel spa and pool good breakfast was a bit slapdash it would have been nice to have toast served to you with your drinks rather than toast it your self. Restaurants were good and staff excellent.,4
"I have been coming back to this hotel for many years. I was welcomed back by all the staff who know me. I had a single room which was huge & not long been done up room 401. It doesn't have a view which didn't bother me. Lovely smellies, tea/coffee,fan, much cooler on this side of the hotel. Bed very comfy tv & safe in the room. Breakfast was excellent with many juices to choose from, cereals,pastries, fruit, bread, toast diff jams, cold or hot as a choice of eggs how you like them cooked, got mine right!!!! Staff for breakfast gave you a warm welcome. Plenty of tea/coffee to your table.I had tea in the coffee shop which is now called ""Garden view"", menu was excellent & a few night BBQ on the terrace after 6.30pm.Saffron is an excellent place to eat, but didn't try it this time.…",5
"Everything first class. Would not hesitate to recommend and will definitely return. Every member of staff from management to house keeping excellent. Facilities brilliant and food first class. Close to town centre and free shuttle bus daily. Plenty of information regarding what's on, and what to do.",5
"If your looking for a place with a pool this is where you should go. It has a full sauna, great gym and of course a stunning indoor pool. Staff very friendly, rooms good especially the refurbished ones. Location is alright with a short 10-15 min walk to the coast.",5
Stayed with a friend in twin room-clean and roomy-no air conditioning so used fan all night.Breakfast very good and food to suit all tastes.Had meal in garden restaurant-attentive staff but some dishes a bit small for price.Quite a walk into town -St Helier quite built up -I suppose I expected post war Jersey !!!War tunnels an experience! island tour by bus good value for money -£20.Nice to go to top of the island we strayed from the tour and ate in pub overlooking the bay -lovely food as cafe was self service.Staff very attentive and informative at the hotel on arrival and departure.,4
"Using the hotel as our base, we spent 5 days travelling around Jersey. The hotel is large and comfortable and our room was spotless. We ate a substantial breakfast each day from a self service buffet and we also dined several times in the Garden Restaurant and on one occasion in Saffron, their Indian restaurant. All our meals were very good. Service is excellent throughout. The hotel is a fifteen minute walk to St Helier centre. We would return!",4
"Hotel staff were all nationalities and made for a very efficiently run hotel, as you would expect from a larger hotel.  No real atmosphere as such, having said that all staff were really friendly Our room 147 was small. The bed was a double and although my partner and myself are not big people we found it very small. The room had no air con and we left the window open. This only helps slightly on the hot days, however had to shut the window around 3am as the seagulls woke us with unrelenting squaking!  We had a view of the roof of the dining room!  Not sure if we picked a low grade room, but didn't think so  The spa and pool area was amazing. I had 2 by treatments and their treatment area was ne of the best I have seen. Pool, sauna, steam area is also excellent. Gym facilities…",4
"Have been many times and I love the place.   Excellent hotel pool. Good food.   My very minor adverse comment is that they could do with conditioner and hair straightener for use in pool changing rooms, but definitely not a reason not to stay! ",5
"Maybe give a little more of an extensive menu in the garden restaurant for those who don't like Indian food. We had a great time the pool and spa facilities were amazing, the staff were really helpful and friendly and the shuttle bus was a great idea.",5
"This hotel is superb, so clean throughout, staff fabulous, helpful and friendly, Food could not be faulted. Our room was wonderful with a view over St Helier. A bit of a walk to the town and bus station but manageable or a minibus service available. Overall I cannot express how much we enjoyed our stay, didn't want to go home after the week.",5
"Hotel de France is perfectly situated to discover the island of Jersey. A beautiful garden with lovely flowers invites to rest or read in the sun or under a parasol at the sun lawn. You will find a large indoor swimming pool with sauna, private spa and health club. Shopping and good restaurants in St. Hellier are on the doorstep in walking distance.  ",5
"Lovely food and drink. Guest areas spacious, but bedroom was pretty standard and ordinary considering how the actual hotel looked very impressive externally. No air conditioning just a standard fan. Room was clean though.",3
"An old style hotel occupying a very large building which must be a nightmare for the owners to maintain! Whilst there are shortcomings, all the staff I encountered were excellent adding value to the offer. Breakfast was ok but could be a little more professional i.e. availability of porridge (slow to come) and a colleague wanted a fried egg had to wait over ten minutes! Very slow running lifts!",4
"Although informing the hotel in a note to them made when I booked and prepaid , on arrival they informed us there was only one standard double room left, room 148 was tiny about 16ft square including the bathroom, over crowded with 2 armchairs one placed at the bottom of the bed and the other to the side, there was no room to walk around the bed and no room for any luggage, the bed is old and sags, the sheets were similar old. The bathroom very dated small, stand alone sink on which the glasses were placed with the soaps on the top as there was no other place to put them, the mirror above is loosing its mirror ring and to the side is one small narrow glass shelf, which once you had the toiletries left room just about left room for my wife's make up bag only!  Dirty and old…",1
"Simply a must place to stay on a beautiful island. Weather was great. Staff were extremely friendly. Food was very good and not overpriced. The spa area was very relaxing. My first trip to Jersey,  don't think it will be my last and will definitely stay at the Hotel de France on my return",4
My wife and I had a Spa room above the leisure facilities. Excellent size and well appointed. Balcony could have had more comfortable furniture but it was functional. Breakfast in the Garden Room was VG. Food at dinner (only dined once) was VG but service dreadfully slow. All in all the best hotel we have stayed in on the island.,5
We came here in 2015 and decided to come back again.   Rooms excellent and the Spa and pool facilities are perfect.  The garden and patio area are great for sunbathing too.  Staff are very attentive and helpful.  Well recommended.  Will visit again.,5
"Hotel de France is situated on a hill a short walk from the centre of St Helier. We had an executive room, which was spacious and well-furnished with a spa bath and an enormous and very comfortable bed. The rate included reliable wifi access, plenty of free covered parking, access to the hotel's spa and a plentiful breakfast. The spa, with its swimming pool, sauna and steam room, massage pool, plunge pool, hot pool  and sunbathing area, made for a great start to the day. Staff were unfailingly welcoming and professional. Overall, we were really quite impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended!",5
"We had the spa room with balcony. Very spacious with high ceiling. There is however a premium for this room and I am not too sure whether that premium is worth the extra over (say) the standard room (going by the photos). Extremely attentive staff.  Substantial choices for breakfast. Very quick to freshen up what was on offer. Gardens lovely with direct access to warm pool. However, there are steep steps from the main road up to the hotel entrance and it may be that some guests with infirmities would struggle up to the entrance. Although there is a courtesy bus to the town centre, it is only a 10/15 minute walk.",5
We were here for weekend away with friends. Thoroughly enjoyed jersey. Hotel was clean well maintained though a little dated but are apparently being done up bit by bit. Grand looking building. Spa looked gorgeous though I didn't get time to use it. Staff were attentive. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. This room is very dated and needs some attention. Still recommend this hotel. ,4
"10 of us stayed here for business for two nights. We travelled from Leeds to Bournemouth, then got the Ferry over and arrived in the afternoon. We checked in quickly with the help of friendly staff. The lobby is a great space for meeting to convene before you go out or stay in. Whichever you prefer. The amount of space in the hotel is incredible too. I fortunately got a view that showed off the whole island so for me was great... others in the party got internal views though which for them wasn't the best.   The bar/restaurant area was also a great space too. We had drinks before we headed out into the town for food. The restaurant prices at Hotel De France were quite pricy. Breakfast was good though and again, in the Orangery (another incredible space)... there was so much…",4
Fabulous hotel. Hotel swimming pool is excellent with lovely outside area for sun bathing. Spa room with balcony very spacious with large bathroom. Generally beautifully designed whilst keeping the original features in the older part of the hotel. Courtesy bus down in to town.,4
Loved this hotel. Amazing grounds and the best spa ever. Breakfast was excellent with great choice. Staff were always on hand to help in anyway. Garden view restaurant food very tasty although my Rose wine was warm. Disappointed only with the size of our room.we booked a standard double for £144 per night which did include breakfast. The walk into town took 15 mins and was quite pleasant. Lovely hotel but would upgrade next time to a bigger room.,4
"This excellent and historical property is always immaculate conception throughout with first class guest rooms, wonderful staff, superb breakfast, excellent spa, and beautiful gardens  Quietly located just a 15 minutes walk away from St Helier's fine shops. Our regular Jersey address",5
"Absolutely faultless. Friendly and helpful staff, Food available anytime and excellent. Great facilities including indoor swimming pools. Terrace and garden great for chilling out. Child friendly and lots of space for them to run around.",5
"A lovely hotel, well positioned with a shuttle bus to take you into town. Immaculate facilities and friendly staff. The spa was particularly good, with access to the garden area. I would definitely return. ",5
"Hotel reception was exceptionally run . Rooms were comfortable , breakfast frustrating , staff in certain areas unfriendly especially at breakfast . Spa superb and a must . Bistro food was excellent and very reasonably priced , staff friendly and helpful .",3
"This is a fantastic hotel except for one thing. We chose this hotel as it stated it had air-conditioning. However, it was not working and when we mentioned this to Reception, they were aware of the problem and they were unable to do anything about it. They did provide us with a fan but unfortunately this did not compensate for the lack of air-con..",4
"Very nice hotel, lovely staff, a little dated in the breakfast restaurant and rooms. The terrace bar area was lovely and our friends were impressed with the spa. The terrace level needs its own toilets rather than going up a floor. Overall a most enjoyable trip",4
"I wasn't overly impressed by the view from my room 121. looking out to a roof with ladders just feet away from my window. Being a single traveller I did not feel very secure. Breakfast choice was not fantastic but adequate. All staff were friendly apart from the maids that forced me out of my room at 9.15, they made it very clear I was in the way. ",3
"This hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the sea front/harbour area. If you do not/ cannot walk well, there are shuttle buses to/from the hotel and public transport is very frequent. The hotel looks good and is good. The hotel is well furbished, clean and well looked after by staff that are well trained and have a pride in their work. All staff are very friendly and helpful, the food is excellent and bedrooms with en suite are a pleasure to stay in. The indoor pools, spa and sauna are the best in any hotel we have stayed in. The water temperature is just right (no getting out shivering) and with a depth of 1.35m over the entire large pool makes all feel very safe. The gardens around the hotel are well cared for and those and the terrace are great on the eyes and really relaxing…",5
"We stayed here for four nights last week after browsing various options on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Such a lovely building inside and out, with the most delightful and helpful staff. I don't think I have ever come across such pleasant and helpful people. Particular thanks to Andreea and Claudia, both absolute sweethearts. Our room looked forward over the town with a glimpse of sea in the distance, and over the gorgeous gardens and terrace to the side. The room itself was spacious, smart and very, very clean. The bathroom was basic but perfectly adequate. Lovely toiletries and fresh fluffy towels. Everything was cleaned daily to a high standard. The room had very generous supplies of tea and coffee making facilities which were replenished daily. Our bed was very,…",5
"We have recently returned from a seven night holiday in Hotel De France Jersey and can honestly say that we enjoyed our stay very much. The grounds, bedrooms, public areas and restaurants were excellent and spotlessly clean. The staff were very professional but also extremely friendly and helpful. We were met by a very warm group of receptionists and this welcome set the standard for the rest of our holiday. I would be happy to recommend Hotel De France to anyone wanting a fantastic holiday in Jersey",5
"Enjoyed our stay. Very nice breakfast,  plenty of choice. Enjoyed having the pool ..nice to have the spa facilities.. Lovely sitting outside having a meal and drinks in the eve.. Have stayed here numerous times over the years..",4
"An amazing building with really great staff who can't do enough for you. We have been to Jersey several times before but never stayed at this hotel. The walk into town did not bother us as we enjoy walking. The hotel also offer a free bus service in and out of town too and we noticed it was quite frequent. The hotel had the wow factor especially the grounds and the amazing Spa. Very clean and peaceful. The room for us which was a standard double was very disappointing, it was too small and difficult to keep the windows open at night as the blind banged in the wind. For that reason I do not think it was worth £144 a night and may well stay nearer town in our usual hotel next time that has much larger rooms. Shame as the hotel itself is very good with amazing staff who went the…",4
Nothing overtly bad to say about this hotel. It is what it is. Would be a lot better if the customer facing east Euro staff spoke decent English and defiantly refrained from talking in native tongue in front of guests. Afternoon tea became problematic just for requesting a couple of slight dietary need and asking for a speciality tea instead of the staple breakfast type. House keeping couldn't understand a simple request for an ironing board. Didn't check out the fitness suite etc so can't comment. Buffet breakfast was fine. The room was an issue in that there's no A/C. If you want A/C open the windows and turn on the Argos type fan supplied but with our room seagulls at 4am screaming outside the open windows wasn't good. We're regulars to the CI's but don't think we'll give…,3
This was my first visit to Jersey and was there for a wedding - I didn't really have a feel for what was good value for money on the island but can only compare it to similar places on the mainland.  The groom suggested to guests that this was where we should stay  I did book a single room - it was comfortable but generally the space was very limited and felt more like a box room so I was never going to have that WOW feeling - The bathroom was very clean and the only niggle was the sink plug which was one of those push down plugs which decided not to push back up when you wanted the water to drain away - admittedly I did not report this but when left for a while the water did eventually drain away. Other than that cleanliness was good throughout The food in the hotel was good…,3
"We stayed this year 2016 at this hotel having stayed previously in 2015.  The hotel's location for us is not a problem as we enjoy walking, so the 20 minute walk into the town or to the seafront is not an issue.  The staff are extremely helpful and make every effort to ensure that your stay is a pleasant one.  We would recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to return.",5
"Clean , but quite outdated and bathroom the same , good breakfast and good helpful staff, value for money at 140 pound  a night not very good . Staff where pleasant  . Eating as main there works out quite  expensive.  ",3
"Only one observation would like a coffee machine in breakfast room . We will be back to stay again and would recommend it over the Royal yacht. Easy walk to town or approx £5 taxi, superb spa with so much space. Well done to all the staff your doing a great job.try and stay in the spa rooms.",5
"The Management of the Hotel De France should be extremely pleased with what they have achieved. Every possible service from the customer service provided by Dionne Britton to the Spa facility, breakfast and house keeping were superb. Congratulations",5
"We have visited this hotel many times over the past few years and we have been delighted every time. The grounds are all well kept, the standard of the hotel overall is excellent and the staff are brilliant. This trip was extra special as my father was celebrating a special birthday, and the rooms we were both given were simply amazing. Thank you so much for making our short trip so wonderful.",5
Overall a really first class stay. The staff are great. Food is brilliant. Rooms are just as expected. Made a great weekend  even better. The facillities are well looked after and easy to use. A must for anyone who like a bit of pleasure,5
Great hotel and staff. Lovely added bonus for having shuttle into town. Made the difference.   Spa was lush and so was food. Possibly A little pricey  in one of the restaurants. But really recommend  and would return   ,4
"I have had to conduct business in a few hotels in the UK and abroad and the receptions staff were brilliant and professional and quick. Nothing was too much trouble. The pool area was relaxing although rowdy children did spoil things on one occasion. Rooms were airy and quiet and always clean. It was a refreshing change to go to a hotel which was not 'corporate' and lacking personality, this was stylish and charming",5
"Hotel seemed a little tired, the room was old fashioned (not in a good way). Breakfast was OK, but not anything special, disappointing as usually love hotel breakfasts. Had lunch one day at the Garden (?) Restaurant the food wasn't good, and the service sloppy. We did use the spa which was lovely; clean, fresh and relaxing, one of the nicest spa's I've been too. ",3
"Me and my boyfriend decided to have an overnight stay at the Hotel De France and make full use of the spa and restaurants they had to offer. From the moment we checked in all the staff were so professional, friendly and polite and couldn't do enough for us. The spa facilities were out of this world and everything was clean, tidy and so welcoming. We decided to eat dinner in the Saffrons restaurant and a special mention to Bogdan, one of the waiters, is well deserved as he was so knowledgeable about all the food and so friendly. Well done to all the staff here at this hotel as they definitely made our stay so lovely and we will definitely be returning.",5
"An imposing first class hotel offering excellent all round facilities especially the spa/swimming pool complex. Staff very efficient and helpful in all departments. On the negative side the hotel is a good distance from the centre and frustratingly difficult to find if you are driving due to the complexity of the one way maize of streets. There is a shuttle bus available at certain times. Also the service bus no.13 stops outside, but there is a long steep climb up to the hotel. A good hotel if you accept the negatives.(A pity that they have built a medical centre in the former grounds of the hotel).",4
"OMG what a fantastic building. Our bedroom was on the 3rd floor overlooking the gardens. Lovely spacious room. Breakfast, loads of choice - loved the Jersey yoghurt. We ate in the Bristo bar - no complaints of quality or quantity. Lovely selection of wines, cocktails, whiskys and brandies. Courtesy bus to and from town during the day, taxis are cheap enough for the evening trips to town. Take the courtesy bus to the bus station get a day ticket £7.50 each for all day, just hop on and off cheaper than doing the tour buses! well recommend - all drivers are more than happy to tell you when you need to get off. Hotel staff would do more, all happy and with smiles. The Spa - lovely to relax and unwind. Pool not too deep.",5
"lovely room, fantastic spa and gym facility Good food for breakfast and evening meal wide choice of menu.Friendly staff overall a lovey stay and I would not only recommend this hotel, I hope to make a return visit in the future!",5
"The breakfast was the best ! The dinnercould have been better. Everything Else was fine. We enjoyed the Stay very much. The garden was Nice, the weather was god. Good service with the shuttle bus ! It was quiet, slept well.",5
My family and I (8 of us in total) stayed for 2 nights and 3 nights and we couldn't find fault with anything. The rooms were spacious and clean. The spa was large with something for everyone. The lounge bar and breakfast area were tidy and the choice of breakfast was immense. ,5
We were a group of 42 pensioners from Norway.  The hotel was a short walking distance from the centre of town. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms small but comfortable. Being a group we only used one of the hotels restaurants but the food was excellent with a good choice at each meal.  The spa and pool area were a bonus.,4
"The hotel is clean & comfortable, and the staff stood out as excellent - really helpful and professional. We had a large family room overlooking the terrace, and everything was clean and well maintained. The general decor throughout is dated and there's quite an eclectic mix of styles, not necessarily intentional ;)  Perhaps the only real downsides were the almost continual background smell of Indian food from the in-house restaurant, and drinks were pretty expensive (£40 for 3 glasses of red wine and 1 beer). Excellent location and very good parking. We would come back. ",4
"This hotel is a bit too far out of town. I wasn't impressed with the cheap bedding, no white cotton sheets here. Pillows flat and cheap. Breakfast very basic, dining room would have been grande in its day but very dated now. ",3
"St.Helier in Jersey was a wonderful experience, Hotel de France was a superb place to stay as it is situated near the town center and in walking distance to the places you'd need to see and to the bus -stop. Lovely hotel, lovely island",5
"Lovely hotel and everything I needed in my room for a comfortable and happy stay. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Great hotel, happy I chose this one and would definitely recommend to friends and family xx",5
Pleased with position of hotel within walking distance of town & restaurants. Beautifully appointed & comfortable. Staff friendly & helpful. Comfortable beds $ spacious rooms. Meals well presented & served quickly & well,4
"Back again after many years staying at this great hotel and as ever they didn't disappoint. From the initial welcome at checkin to the farewell the staff were excellent, professional and dealt with whatever we needed from them.  The breakfast were superb daily and the spa is fantastic.  I can see why its been voted the 7th best spa in Europe.  The room as always was spotlessly clean!! But I was also very glad to see the toiletries now supplied do not contain and SLS or Parabens. This is excellent and wont need to take my own anymore.  Well done Hotel de France! See you again soon.",5
"Just returned from a weeks stay in a spa room at Hotel de France. Staff in all areas of the hotel are warm and friendly and can't do enough for you.  The room was cleaned every day, with a fresh change of bedding and towels. Wide choice of breakfast available, which was regularly topped up to accommodate all guests.  Food in the garden view restaurant was good.  Had one meal which was not as hot as it should have been, but this was quickly rectified by the staff.  Would definitely stay again.",5
"My first visit to this hotel in 38 years was everything I hoped for.  Certain things had changed, the outdoor pool has been replaced with a lovely new indoor one,  however all the things that made this hotel special in the 80's remain. My room was very spacious and the balcony provided a good view. All staff were friendly and genuinely wanted to enhance my stay if possible.  The breakfast was of good quality and there was a good choice available every day.  The walk into the centre of St Helier is a leisurely 10 to 15 journey, however there is a regular shuttle bus from reception each morning.  The jewel in their crown was their in house Indian restaurant, 'Saffrons', quite simply the best Indian food I've ever eaten.  Thank you Jersey for a great holiday,  and thanks to this…",5
"I travelled with friends for a long weekend to Jersey and stayed in this very nice hotel.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Staff are all excellent and friendly.  There is a free shuttle bus that takes you into the main part of St Helier at various times of the day but it is only around a 20min walk, so not far.  The spa is lovely.  The breakfast is very good with something for everyone.  We also did not think that the bar prices were too expensive as is often the case in many hotels.",5
Location is some distance from town centre Courtesy bus does not operate on a sufficiently frequent basis Need to use public transport or walk(1/2 hour)hotel itself was quite acceptable with pleasant garden area but was not outstanding. Breakfasts were very good,3
"Everything about this place is top notch! From the staff at check in, to the cleaners you encounter on the stairs. Hotel is spotless and you regularly see the cleaners polishing the fretwork on the ornate staircases! The breakfast was excellent and there was an extensive choice. This was our second visit and we even brought friends this time. The spa is lovely and a great place to unwind, but the icing on the cake here is Saffrons, their award winning restaurant. If I am going to eat out, I want it to be better than I could make at home - I could certainly never recreate at home what the chefs and the wonderful team do here! Fabulous hotel, about 10-15 mins walk out of St Helier and up a bit of an incline as the hotel is elevated, so if this is a problem you may need a taxi, or…",5
"The facilities are good. The staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient. The Saffron restaurant serves the best Indian cuisine I have ever had bar none!  Unfortunately, it is not open every day even in the peak season. The other eatery run of the mill but OK.  ",4
Lovely hotel with friendly professional staff and excellent facilities throughout. Free regular shuttle bus service complemented Jerseys own excellent bus service.  Food in all restaurants was top quality.  Lovely stay,5
"Stayed for 5 nights in a single room. The room was clean and tidy, but lacked a full length mirror which was disappointing. Breakfast had everything for everyone, couldn't fault the food, and the leisure spa was excellent! Location is a good 20 min walk from the town centre, up a long hill with a steep drive to the  hotel. Ok if you have a car but not if you're walking! This was recommended to me which is why I booked it, but would book somewhere nearer the town if I visited again, especially if I didn't have a car.",4
Very good hotel with very good facilities including for breakfast and evening meal.Very helpful and friendly staff particularly in the reception area.Bedroom more than adequate.Given time available did not visit the spa etc,4
A very nice room overlooking the Town and the coastline of jersey. It is quite central to the centre of st helier and is only a short walk of about ten minutes.there are plenty of restraunts and bars very close by.,5
"A lovely hotel, tastefully furnished and decorated, set well away from the road. The staff are incredibly helpful. The pool area is great and spotlessly clean. Breakfasts cater for all tastes and appetites. The rooms are spacious, and well maintained.",5
"Spent two nights here on business and dined in in the garden restaurant. Food was presented with flair and very reasonably priced. The staff were pleasant, friendly and very, very helpful. Pool, sauna jacquzi etc clean and well maintained. Weekend hours for gym were disappointed and the range of machines available to guests rather than health club members could be improved. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a spa break or to dine out. I did not book this hotel myself and do not know what the room charge was for the two nights.",5
"We stayed for 5 nights Hotel was lovely and scrupulously clean everywhere , the staff were very friendly and professional, nothing was a bother for them. Our room was basic and had a view of adjoining blocks and the glass roof the Indian type restaurant but again very clean and well serviced! The cooked breakfast was the big let down, despite being in containers which is supposed to keep the food at least warm, everything was cold by the time you sat down at your table and that was without waiting for toast to cook! The sausages were worst of all as they looked as if they were poached and not a sign of browning anywhere, this was the trend every day except for our last day! One morning the waitress brought out a new tray of fried eggs so I thought I'll have a nice hot egg today…",3
"This was our second stay. We booked an executive room, which was spacious with a settee and chair in bedroom, a dressing area, and a 2-basin spacious bathroom. Very comfortable all round.  Service across the board was of a very high standard. We ate in the Garden View: service was excellent as was the standard of food. The spa is worth a visit. There is a pool, jacuzzi, sauna,  and a steam room.  All-in-all a very good hotel experience.  The Hotel de France will be our first choice when we next visit Jersey. ",5
"I stayed at Hotel de France for over three weeks and found the people and resort warm and friendly.  They quickly get to know you and try and help and be accommodating as best as possible.  They're quick to assist foreigners with info and advice.  The breakfasts are great with nice hot coffee.  The dining restaurant was great with super food and a nice special every day which is awesome if you stay for a long time as I did.  Occasionally there wasn't space for me if there were big tour groups, but then room service was just as efficient.  Saffron, the other restaurant, is great, although expensive, but it is a fine dining experience.  Remember to book.   ",5
"I took my elderly parents here and we all loved the hotel. I had a hire car which I would recommend as the Hotel was slightly away from the Centre up a hill, although they do have a shuttle bus which operates during the day. The breakfast was great and served in a lovely big room with glass ceiling making it bright and airy. There was a lovely restaurant with terrace where you could get both lunch & dinner and also another more formal restaurant at night so plenty of choice. I had a single room which was pretty small but to be fair the price reflected that but my parents double room was gorgeous with lots of Windows looking down into St Helier and the sea front. At night there was a lovely bar to enjoy a night cap before bed. My Mum and I visited the pool area which was gorgeous…",5
"Very good facilities & staff were pleasant & courteous. Only slight criticism was that the room was too hot, even with all the windows open overnight. As a result I didn't sleep much, despite the very comfortable bed. Suggest that instead of just a single duvet the hotel should add a linen sheet so you can still remove the duvet & leave some covers in place. ",4
"The Hotel De France was an excellent Hotel .Friendly staff , clean well presented rooms and comfy beds .Superb breakfasts in the Orangery , from cereals ,fruit  and pastry's to a full English . Great spa and pool facilities . Will defiantly book again .",5
Very nice hotel kept very clean with comfortable rooms and good food and drinks.Shuttle handy for a trip to town. Staff all very welcoming and helpful. Would recommend a stay here for a weekend or longer.,4
"We were really pleased with all the facilities, the spa and swimming pool rated very highly. The grounds around the hotel were lovely. The courtesy bus into the centre of St Helier ran on time. The could not have been better.",5
"Booked the hotel having read the positive reviews, and we are not disappointed, we had a junior suite firstly with magnificent view all very the city. We changed rooms, only due to the original room being booked. Our next room is also very nice, it's a nice walk down into town albeit weather is not nice at the moment even though it's supposed to be summer! A little bit of constructive criticism: not enough staff at breakfast. Reception staff and bar staff most helpful. We are having a nice stay! Spa is wonderful!!",4
Our room though fitted with disability shower was very modern with excellent facilities. Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist. Saffron Dining was an amazing experience wish we had more time to have booked again,5
Service was excellent throughout hotel but breakfast service was unreliable at times. Room very comfortable with a lovely view over St Helier. Spa was excellent and the swimming pools were first class. ,4
"Lovely hotel and staff very friendly and helpful. Didn't have the best view from our room (303) but it didn't spoil our stay. Breakfast had plenty of choice, and we even ate in the garden view restaurant which wasn't expensive.  ",5
"Facilities (spa and gym) excellent, room was large and comfortable, but the newly refurbished section has VERY noisy air conditioning that meant no sleep, restaurant (Indian) service was very slow (30 mins between courses) and food was great but very very small portions.",3
"This was my second visit at the hotel. I was very impressed with my first time here with my family and so I decided to take my boyfriend. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They organised a hire car for us too which was very quick and easy. The hotel, including the room, was clean and it is decorated very well. We used the pool, steam room and sauna during our stay and it is by far the best pool and facilities I have ever used. There is a wide variety of food to choose from at breakfast to start your day.",5
"The hotel was good value for money.  It enjoys an excellent location about 15minutes walk from the town centre which is an easy walk apart from the very steep steps on the way back in to the hotel.  It has one of the best pools and spa facility that I have experienced.  Breakfast was fine with plenty of choice though the quality of the cooked breakfast did depend somewhat on the time you arrived in the restaurant.  The food in the hotel is expensive but there are plenty of places to eat within a twenty minute walk.  The room was large and well decorated, but the mattres were a little thin and too soft for me.",4
I go to Jersey regularly & the hotel de France is always a favourite. I feel comfortable being a business woman sometimes traveling alone. Also a great pool & gym. The curtesy bus into town saves me having to move the hire car.,4
Excellent Hotel excellent room very good food could have done with more staff at breakfast time as not enough staff to deal with the amount of guests arriving at the one time. Parking for disabled was very good and very ner the Hotel entrance,5
"We booked this hotel due to the reviews and how nice it looked online and we were not let down,  hotel and spa are excellent and the service from the staff is second to none. We had a balcony room and this was amazing, will definitely be back,  lovely location and thanks to the hotel for the bottle of proseco and fruit for our anniversary 😃😃",5
"My mother and I arrived mid afternoon after getting lost on this small island, to be greated by  very friendly staff, helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Clean rooms and a lovely meal in the restaurant. ",5
"Two nights on a business trip. In room WiFi worked very well, comfortable beds, nice and quiet, breakfast buffet was usual hotel standard fayre (sadly didn't have time to try the a la carte due to an unfortunate diary issue on my own part). Spa was lovely. Would stay again on business.",4
"Over night stay away from the children.  Relaxing in the amazing spa. Evening cocktails before a five star  quality spectacular evening Indian meal. Room was good, modern adequate Breakfast was good late down so not everything/much left, but good spread and all the options. Over all would go back and recommend to friends.",3
"Came over to participate in motor show at people's park, hotel was spacious, very clean and staff were extremely helpful and courteous at all times. Stayed in single room which was clean and comfortable. ",5
"Lovely hotel, comfortable and the staff couldn't be nicer. On the down side, the selection of fruit at breakfast is cheap and boring, and the hill up to the hotel is not for the faint hearted. On the plus side, the leisure facilities are excellent, the staff are exceptional and the rooms are clean and comfortable.",4
"Lovely hotel,clean ,great room with comfy bed,food is lovely,people are lovely and the spa is heaven ,been many times and will be going back again I hope.,can't really fault it. Best spa hotel on jersey.",5
If you are unlucky to be allocated one of the older rooms then my experience having visited on quite a few occasions is that they old fashioned and of poor quality I'm afraid! Sadly this detracts from a Hotel whose overall service and other facilities are very good.,4
"A relaxing stay with wonderful staff who were very helpful. We use a wheelchair so the only drawback are the steep slopes up to the hotel, a simple walk into town needed a lot of muscle power. Apart from that we would recommend this hotel. ",5
Fantastic room with balcony and view. Really excellent spa. Good value nice food well served up by happy people. I have been visiting this hotel for many years and it just seems to get better and better,5
"This hotel has impecable customer service, all of the staff were smiley and helpful, the food for room service was delicious and not at all over priced like most hotels, £13 for a burger, chips and a massive bowl of creme brulee and a coke! and £5 for the tray to be collected! Amazing!!  Really couldn't ask for better service, managed to get an extra hour in the hotel while we waited for the shuttle bus so checked out at 12 instead of 11, and bless their hearts it was free of charge as long as we checked out on time (which we did) and even though we had checked out we were still allowed to get the shuttle bus into town and had the option of leaving our bags at the hotel! - we were kept well informed and every was lovely!  As for the room, it was huge and the balcony was…",5
"Overall a great hotel and superb location , staff fantastic more than helpful, bed very comfortable , room a good size with tea and coffee making facilities. Swimming pool fantastic , sauna jacuzzi and cold plunge pool and hot plunge pool too steam room nice and relaxing . ",5
"Imposing building high up overlooking St Hellier. Free parking easy walk down into town. Been visiting for 10 years, there are flashier more modern hotels but the spa and pool are epic. Even my 21 year old (not impressed by anything) was blown away. Breakfast awesome too. Friendly service if you are coming to Jersey stay here!",5
Booked in January and I thought room would have been better as It was very poor however rest of hotel lovelly. At breakfast waited 20 min for coffee and asked 3 members of staff. First night in room found hankies in bed which led me to think that bedding had not been changed from previous visitors.,3
"My sister and I recently spent four nights at the hotel.  As she is a nervous traveller I had requested that our single rooms be close to one another. We were across the corridor from one another which wasn't a problem. My room was the better of the two, being a corner room which allowed pl enty of light. Unfortunately my sister was allocated a room which was rather dark and dreary with an inter-connecting door which allowed her to experience nightly 2 hour telephone conversations from the person adjoining, so not much privacy there. We were offered a change of room but unfortunately it would have been on another corridor. For the price, I would say that the rooms were quite dated with very old fashioned wardrobes but everything was clean and in good condition but overall I…",4
"The hotel was wonderful and the staff are all extremely pleasant and obliging. The hotel itself is just a short walk away from St. Helier so if you like it peaceful this is the hotel to stay at. Jersey itself is a very pretty island, but please be aware when hiring a car and the speed limits and rules and regulations change from district to district. The maximum speed on the island is 40mph most of the roads are 30 and some of them are 20. There are some brilliant restaurants and I would highly recommend the Seascale at Gorey Harbour booking highly recommended.",5
"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our time at the hotel - our room was most comfortable with a view across St Helier, after breakfast we relaxed each morning in the spa and enjoyed sunbathing in the garden.  We had friends join us for an excellent lunch on the terrace and drinks in the cocktail bar.  From arrival to departure we were made to feel very welcome.",5
Exelent for solo cyclists. As you can use the spa facilities. After you check out the shower after your bike ride. The staff have been there for some time so they are well informed  Beautiful gardens and verandas,5
"This was an excellent short stay. The staff were professional and calm... our room was very well presented and nothing was missing. Clean, quiet and modern but not clinical. Terrific and I will be returning as soon as I can..",4
Brilliant hotel with great staff. Room was a bit small but very clean. Food was absolutely fantastic and highlight of whole stay. Breakfast was very good with lots of choice. Only drawback of hotel was the distance to centre of St Hellier. Buses do go but very infrequent. If you don't mind 20 minute walk to town centre then this hotel is worth staying at.,4
"Everything you could possibly need under one roof.  Magic.  Amazing Indian cuisine, not as you'd know it. Superb.  Rooms are super clean, immaculate, with wonderful heated floor in the bathroom!  Spa is beautiful and every thing you could need in the gym.",4
"Had fantastic view out of our room. Spa facilities and swimming pool was amazing, having a swim every morning before breakfast. Definitely will come again. Thank you to all the staff as they were really helpful and knowledgeable. Keep up the good work",5
"My husband and I went for our anniversary over a bank holiday weekend. The room was spacious and well appointed. Our reception was good. We ate in both restaurants and the food and service was very good. There is a fairly limited choice of wine. We did not try the spa facilities . I believe the hotel was full however we hardly Saw another guest - restaurants lacked a bit of atmosphere-  Our disappointment was only In that the hotel, which was clearly once very grand, has sold off all its surrounding land and so has ugly buildings all around it spoiling all The views- from balconies and terraces and Windows all around. Such a shame. It's a 10 minute walk into town - so well placed . I think if I was to revisit jersey I would opt for the radisson which will have excellent views…",4
"The location was lovely parking was ample and the spa and pool was relaxing. The breakfast was more than enough and catered for everybody. The saffron restaurant was amazing, the quality and presentation was lovely.",5
This is not anything approaching a four star hotel. The room was wide but very narrow. The bathroom was small - very low ceiling over the sink so that you could not use the sink fully. Asked staff to order a taxi that took credit cards. Waited 30 mins and only learned at the airport that - no - the taxi didn't take cr cards. Breakfast was poor and very slow. ,2
"Second visit and as pleased if not more then the first  visit Excellent hotel with great staff, clean, rooms great size and extremely comfortable  Breakfast is really good Highly recommend and will be returning ",5
"Reasonable value for money Food available at all times and good quality especially breakfast - full range available Plenty of car parking Convenient location in St.Helier - short walk to shopping area Friendly, helpful staff Clean, modern rooms Health facilities available included in the price Beds a little soft for our taste but not uncomfortable  ",4
We had a very pleasant overnight stay. We stayed in one of the spa rooms and had lunch on the terrace followed by some time in the Spa.  We had dinner in Saffrons which is one of our favourite restaurants in the Island. The staff made us very welcome as we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and they treated us to an extra dessert and a couple of glasses of bubbly. ,5
The facilities and staff at this hotel are both excellent. They offer a wide range of food for breakfast as well as dinner. The spa and gym facilities are also excellent with plenty to do for everyone. The location is also idea with a quick walk into the centre of town. Highly recommended ,5
"Large infamous hotel of Jersey, great facilities, but if you want to use the spa on the last day after checkout you will be robe-less as staff will not provide and tell you you should have brought the one from your room, which is kind of catch-22.  otherwise we had great stay and both restaurants have great food!! loved it.  ",4
"Excellent hotel in a great location, worth every penny. It's a 15min walk to the city centre which I particularly enjoyed as it means peace and quiet.  The staff was lovely and helpful, Gemma managed to find me a room at the very last minute.  Spacious, clean and comfortable room overlooking the patio with all necessary amenities. Excellent room service for dinner and good breakfast in the restaurant.  Will definitely be back.  Nothing to fault at all. ",5
"We stayed for 5 nights at the beginning of May.  We had a comfortable good sized standard room overlooking the garden/patio at the front of the hotel, with a nice view.  There were a couple of points about the room that would have made this a five star review and I am not usually that fussy, but, 1. there was nowhere to put wet coats (it was raining when we arrived) as no hooks on the back of the door, so they ended up on the two chairs (only other place would have been the wardrobe with our clothes), 2. there was no extractor fan in the bathroom, so it got very 'foggy' and damp in there and took a while to clear, and lastly, there was not any kind of shelving/drawers for clothing (the wardrobe just had hanging space), so we ended up putting jumpers etc on an area under the TV. …",4
"We stayed for my husbands birthday treat. A lovely room in the newer part of the hotel, good size with comfy bed and great shower. Breakfast was good, and the lounge bar relaxing. The outside area for lunch also good. It's a 15 minute walk to the town which was great for us, however, it is at the top of a hill so if you want to walk, bear that in mind. A great stay. Staff were friendly and helpful too. ",4
"We had good service throughout our 5 night stay, even changing rooms for a bigger bed after 2 nights was no problem to the staff and dealt with quickly with no fuss. The spa is a bit of a gem, we only used the good sized pool, but pre breakfast was generally quiet and a good start to the day. Breakfast, whilst plentiful from the ubiquitous buffet, was a little disappointing in taste for us.  Fresh fruit salad and Jersey yogurt didn't disappoint but the rest, although extensive, lacked that fresh bright 'wake up!' hit we like. Saffron's Restaurant in the hotel was lovely and a meal there on the first night set high expectations which the breakfast and breakfast room let down a little. Overall a good stay, the hotel is a 20 min brisk walk from the sea front and in the hotel we…",4
"I keep coming back because it is well situated for going down into St. Helier, the facilities are very good and the staff are excellent. As a woman travelling alone I need to feel comfortable and safe and have always felt this here.",4
"We booked a girls weekend stay for one night, the spa pools were the highlight!  I reckon the best in Jersey! This included in the May b&b deal makes it a n absolute bargain plus the most comfortable hotel bed I've stayed in for a while. ",5
"We stay two nights during the last week and appreciate the room, the personal very kind; also the huge quality of the breakfast, under the sky, and we enjoy too the SPA which is  ""super"". This hotel is really attractive.",5
"We booked a Spa room, and I believe it was worth the difference. Quiet, spacious and better appointed than standard rooms. Also great view of St Helier.  Indoor pools are a true selling point (specially if weather isn't great) but they can get busy and loungers go very quickly.  Spa is exceptional. I had a pregnancy massage and my therapist really knew what she was doing.  We ate once at their more relaxed restaurant (Garden View?) and foods was good.  The only slight let down was the breakfast restaurant. We went in March, so not high season, and they couldn't manage a half full room very well. Food would run out and would not be replaced. In terms of quality, it was ok, but standard.  All Staff were polite and accommodating.",4
"I stayed for four nights to relax and unwind. The staff were very friendly and would go out there way to help you.  I spent hours in the spa and even had a massage, which was one of the best I've had. Whenever I go to jersey I tend to stay here or in one other hotel, which is a lot as I am Jersey born.  I have recommended this hotel to my friends and they also have a great stay. ",5
Excellent hotel for a stay in Jersey whether business or holiday. The rooms are excellent. Well furnished. Beds extremely comfortable. The staff are very friendly and make a big effort to please their guests. The pool area is one of the best with brilliant hot tub. A gymnasium is also available as are Indian massages. The spa restaurant is very reasonably priced and again with friendly and helpful service. I can find nothing to fault in this hotel.,5
"Friendly and helpful staff, supreme English breakfasts, a very comfortable room, a great pool with jacuzzi and sauna, free car-park... We particularly enjoyed the old-world style of the Hotel de France, and the fact that it is very peaceful, while being within walking distance of  downtown St Helier. ",5
"Impressive hotel with very good catering facilities and most helpful young staff.  Only downside was the small standard double bed - unusual in this age for a 4 star hotel.  Although situated a little outside St. Helier centre, a shuttle-bus service is available.",4
"We loved our stay at the Hotel de France and would definitely stay again. Our room was on the top floor and it was stunning! Being a corner room, it had a lot of natural light and was spacious, with enough room for two comfortable seats and a dressing table. The breakfast was fantastic, with options of buffet style and/or freshly cooked to order items, such as omelette & kippers.  Breakfast was served in a room with a glass roof and plenty of morning light, although there is the option to have breakfast brought to  your room for a small tray charge. We did not utilise the gym and so cannot review but it looked impressive from the outside. However, we enjoyed the pools and steam room/sauna, with their excellent changing facilities. Every member of staff was friendly, polite and…",4
"Lovely hotel, great choice at breakfast which seemed no rush to leave the breakfast room. Lovely room overlooking the front of the hotel and across the bay at St Helier. Spa facilities nice and an extra benefit and staff friendly. The same could not be said about the staff in the gym not friendly or welcoming and quite patronizing. , didn't return to use the gym facilities after this experience. Hotel is located a little out of town and in a quiet location. Not many restaurants near the hotel without going into town. Used hotel restaurant was nice but quite expensive. Would return to this hotel very nice",4
"We booked this hotel over the net for our honeymoon.   We really enjoyed the look of the hotel from the description and the fact that is a kid free zone:)  We arrived in the sunshine(always makes you feel better) and the classic french look of the hotel was lovely.   We checked in and had our bags taken to our room(upgraded from standard, thank you so much) the views are lovely over the town and we could see the sea and castle.   We had cream tea in the garden view restaurant, ate outside in the sun.   We found the facilities amazing, the choice of 2 restaurants amazing but I would highly recommend the garden view restaurant over saffrons as you can really get what you want from all over the world, the steak was lush but please try the seafood linguini.   Pool is good enough to…",5
"Impressive façade with newer extensions.  Staff very helpful, professional and friendly.  We chose this hotel as it is one of the few TA listed hotels in Jersey with wheelchair access and a large accessible room with wet room with balcony at the spa end of the hotel. This proved very quiet with a view over the roof tops to the sea in the distance.  The hotel has a long and interesting history; the older sections are pretty much as one would expect and contrasted with the minimalist style of the much newer spa end. The breakfast buffet area was different again with a more contemporary feel.  (We felt it would benefit from table cloths more in keeping with the hotel's star rating.)  Breakfast was well presented and had quite a range but we have seen better elsewhere although what…",4
"Pleased with our choice; lovely setting, great service, very good food, friendly, professional, helpful staff. Fantastic spa / gym facilities. 10 - 15 minute walk to St Helier centre. Wanted a quiet location and this worked well. Very good choice and quality of breakfast for a 'buffet' style arrangement. Room clean and comfortable. Our only criticism is that the bed was a bit small - we're used to 'king-size' or 'super-king-size' beds in hotels and this seemed smaller so our sleep quality was affected a little by this.",4
"This was my first trip to Jersey and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  From the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly and helpful and couldn't have done enough for us.  The rooms were well decorated, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The whole hotel is very spacious and bright.  The bar does the best cocktails and although we didn't eat in the restaurant I did have the afternoon tea which was beautifully presented and delicious.  I spent a morning in the fabulous spa and would definitely recommend it.  Probably one of the best places I have ever visited.  I most certainly will return to Jersey and would be delighted to return to this hotel.",5
"I stayed here for one night last week while stopping off for a long weekend, what a pleasure this hotel was, the staff here were great, helped me out with the finest of things, I.e. Phone chargers, tooth paste as I come bery late and I'm organised, typical of me, food was great, beautiful rooms, great building.",5
"A combination of a clean and airy room, comfortable bed, speedy wifi, attentive service, tasty and healthy food with all food intolerances catered for and accessible car-parking all made for a successful business trip. The added bonus was the amazing and unique spa, good sized pool plus a beauty saloon meant that I could balance work with some downtime. Next time I may see more of Jersey but this Hotel can certainly cater for business and adult holiday customer. A return visit to the Spa will definitely be on my list. I would certainly recommend you check it out if you're visiting Jersey.",5
"The hotel is located in a quiet area of St Helier yet within walking distance to the centre of town.  Ideal for business meetings and as a base.  Staff are very professional and friendly and cannot do enough for you.  Excellent spa, pool  and restaurants.",5
A really excellent hotel within easy reach of St Helier town centre and understand family owned.. This is a recent stay in an hotel we have frequented in the past. Staff and service excellent.as always. Free parking within the grounds.The next time in Jersey will again be staying at Hotel De France.,5
"Our overnight stay was very much a spur-of-the-moment decision and as a result we got a last minute price. We weren't expecting anything special as we were very much 'budget' guests. Our room was very clean and comfortable but a little on the small side and was also next to the lift shaft, hence a bit of occasional noise but nothing awful. The hotel itself is a little dated but the spa area is lovely and has excellent facilities. The staff in every area of the hotel were both charming and efficient. What did impress us was the value for money for food and wine. We anticipated high prices but this was not the case. A slight down side was the distance from town which is quite a trek. Sadly the hotel shuttle bus doesn't go into town in the evening or operate on Sundays. Having…",4
"Visited for a short break (4 nights) for my birthday. Hotel is on a hill overlooking the town, and is a historic site (originally built in 1866). Our room had a great view over the town, good facilities. The pool area is lovely, we arrived Sunday, so it was busy ( I suspect lots of day spa visitors) but there was plenty of room & it's nicely laid out. The staff in the hotel are great, nothing is too much trouble, and very welcoming. We used this as a base to see Jersey as never been before, but I would come back here for a relaxing break in the future. We had hired a car, and there is plenty of parking. You can also walk down into the town, takes about 15 - 20 mins. We booked room only but did have some meals at the Garden View restaurant which is very good, nice choices, and a…",5
Would have emailed hotel direct but seems to be no facility to do so. Ordered a pot of tea after my lunch and it was not only half full but clearly not from boiling water. The young lady claimed it was - so much for the customer always being right - but asked that she fill it with boiling water. A nice touch would have been to have a fresh teabag but that is too much to expect. So after the first lukewarm tea had hot very weak tea. Some staff training clearly in order.,3
This hotel is lovely to stay at where I couldn't fault any of our stay. Location is near town with a short walk. Definitely a must stay! Breakfast offers a wide choice with great quality. Pool and spa worth a visit! ,5
"A beautiful hotel, in a quiet location. a 5-10 minute taxi ride in to St Helier or if you are fit then a 15 minute walk. The Boat show was on during our visit and lots of activities happening in St Helier. Take the Petit Train to St Aubin a lovely scenic ride and a very good commentary . We took the 1/2 day tour of the island. - Very pretty. We will be going back!",5
This was our Second stay at the Hotel de France and both times we were impressed with the accommodation and the meals we ate here which included breakfast and evening meals and the helpful staff both in the hotel and when using the spa facilities would recommend this hotel.,5
"I stay at the Hotel de France on a regular basis. I would not stay anywhere else. The staff are professional, efficient and friendly.  The rooms are well maintained and comfortable. The food is delicious and the service is always first class. ",5
"Classy building, brilliant and helpful staff and above all a new built excellent spa with good range of treatments at reasonable price. The spa gets booked very quickly and disappointingly we were able to book only a few treatments at not the most convenient time for us.     The hotel is 10-15 minutes walk from Liberation Square, but they run 5-6 free shuttles everyday (I think excluding Sunday). Also there is a small shop in the hotel with local convenience store only 3 minutes away.   Rooms were comfortable and our room on 3rd floor had a good view from window.  Good speed free wifi  The hotel had 3 restaurants. We used the Garden view restaurant and room service. Food was delicious and value for money. Breakfast was above average. Unfortunately they charged £5 per tray for…",5
"Although this classic hotel is slightly out of town, the class and graciousness of the staff and the facilities outweigh this. Set in a huge modernized, wonderful old building with excellent facilities and very helpful friendly caring staff, the room was very comfortable and we enjoyed our overnight stay. The buffet breakfast was a notch up on many others in terms of selection and freshness. Their free bus service into the centre of St Helier was much appreciated. We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Wonderful hotel, staff great , helpful and friendly, room spotlessly clean, had robe and plenty of tea and coffee, hair drier and safe. Breakfast had lots of choice , room service was fast and quality of food was good. The hotel had a bus stop right outside for 3 separate bus routes which was very convenient. It is a bit of a walk to the  town centre and I would not consider the hotel suitable for very elderly people as access is up quite a steep slope, however there is a courtesy bus to and from town. The spa and health club were  brilliant and the staff very knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5
Excellent hotel with very friendly staff and lovely spa.  Superb view over St Helier from our first floor room. Large choice at breakfast in the bright airy orangery.  Meal in garden view restaurant nice. Plenty of car parking (no charge). ,4
"although a few minutes walk from the centre of St Helier this hotel ticks all the boxes, very good food, comfortable, excellent service, this time I booked a single room and found it lacking an iron and board so I couldn't iron my sheet for my meeting the following day .... but I couldn't be bothered to ask for one !!! my evening meal there was very good indeed. this is the second time I have stayed there and if I should have to go back to Jersey I would book again without bothering to look elsewhere.",4
"We stayed in a Spa Room during a brief trip to Jersey in late January.  There was a bit of dwell before our arrival was acknowledged, but generally we found  Reception and Restaurant staff to be welcoming and efficient.  Our room was in the modern Spa wing, with a balcony facing over St Helier towards the sea.  The room was very large with good amenities and spacious, luxurious bathroom (with great rain shower).  The décor was a bit odd - could do with more furnishings and pictures to get rid of a slightly spartan feel.  Bed was comfy though, and wifi free and fast.  Breakfast was a very pleasant surprise, and is what made us rate the Hotel de France 5/5.  The buffet was extensive and all food well cooked and fresh.  The eggs were particularly good - rare for a large hotel. …",5
"We spent a nice weekend break at this hotel, very pleasing welcome and lovely room, food in the Saffron restaurant was first class and a nice full English breakkie served in the room, the spa is outstanding and the staff we're extremely pleasant all in all a great hotel with just the right balance",5
Stayed here with my boyfriend over the bank holiday weekend in May. We had a nice stay the staff are very friendly the rooms are clean and spacious. The spa facilities were very good and so was the buffet breakfast in the morning. The drive way is deceiving as the actual hotel is behind another building which is an eyesore.,3
"As always an excellent stay ,staff very welcoming and knowledgeable about Jersey attractions. Breakfasts are wonderful as is the Spa area.  The location of the hotel is very convenient to the main town St Helier. As a regular returning guest I can only recommend the hotel and Jersey itself. ",5
Superb welcome. Lovely surroundings. Brilliant food. Every detail most professional but welcoming. Great experience through out including Spa. The surroundings were most relaxing especially after a very early start from UK.,5
had a lovely time just the bedroom too hot in April to sleep at night... overall good value for money. will come back again. the island is amazing and well served by public transport overall enjoyable break  ,5
"Lovely Hotel, if only a little bit of a walk into Town if you have no car & entrance up to it not so inviting Very clean , great breakfast facility & very friendly staff Only Hotel I have been to though around the world that has not recognised my or my wife's Birthday or out Anniversary, not even a bowl of fruit or a  drink on the house , shame , so a few points dropped for that !!",3
"Had a lovely stay, room for was more than adequate, but all bars and restaurants seemed under staffed and not able to cope with even small about of guests. Reception and spa was amazing. As a whole the building could do with updating, it seemed quite dated apart from the pool/spa area which was one of the best I have seen in a hotel of this level.",3
"This imposing hotel couldn't have been better for our romantic spa getaway. It has a certain old-fashioned charm, but in a good way, with its wide carpeted corridors and grand staircase. It does what you want from a hotel - big fluffy white towels and robes,  good-sized comfy rooms with views and very friendly and helpful staff.  The spa is one of the best I've been to - certainly one of the best massages I've had - with various hot and cold pools, sauna and steam rooms and plenty of treatments to choose from.  Also had an amazing meal in its Garden View restaurant. They totally beat our expectations, delivering really high quality food with real flair.",5
"Late in writing this review but still wanted to do it. Got married in this hotel 16 years ago and everything about the hotel was excellent, returned sixteen years later to find this hotel still excellent. Staff polite and helpful in every way, food in the hotel outstanding and facilities excellent and hotel itself in perfect location and clean and very friendly. Will not leave it as long next time thank you for making our weekend.",5
"Lovely hotel. Excellent single room, clean towels every day, well-stocked hospitality tray, superb breakfast, and first class Spa facility. Very friendly/helpful front of house staff. Well-stocked hotel bar facility, with nibbles served with all drinks orders.",5
"This is a very well-run hotel, with excellent facilities and very helpful staff. Although the hotel itself is on rather a grand scale, the various areas are accessible, comfortable and well maintained. The staff are delightful, very friendly and professional.  ",5
"A magnificent hotel, with the grandeur of a bygone age but all the facilities we expect of an hotel in the 21st century. The staff, largely foreign, were extremely helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.  We would not hesitate to return.",5
I've stayed here many times never had a problem of any sort.  The staff can't do enough for you never had a problem with my room.  The food 1st class.  Would highly recommend the Hotel De France.  Please experience this wonderful hotel. ,5
"We had a lovely weekend with a very comfortable room, excellent food in the Garden Restaurant for dinner and very friendly attentive staff in all areas of the hotel. We have stayed many times before and will definitely stay again when next in Jersey.",5
First came here 21 years ago shortly after a major fire at the hotel and it was still superb  21 years on many changes on and even better great swimmimg pool safron restaurant Indian fusion cooking especially the taste tester is a must  Service first class room excellent ,5
"First time at this hotel and had a great time ,we stayed in a spa room that looked out over St Helier,The staff was extremely helpful and the food was excellent,hopefully it is the first of many a stay .",5
Just returned from 4 nights in this wonderful hotel 2nd of hopefully many more stays. Great staff and fantastic facilities including the spa and pool. Great restaurants and bars. Even provides shuttle bus service into town centre. ,5
"When we got there we were asked at reception about why we were visiting Jersey.  We told them it was our 44th anniversary. We left our bags and went for dinner, when we  got to our room there was a bottle of bubbly and a large bowl of fruit.  The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel was perfect. The food was great.  We are already planning to go back.",5
"Myself and family have just enjoyed a 3 day break we have stayed at this hotel previously but it has been updated and improved excel ant gym and swimming pool sauna steam room etc  Very good breakfast selection with choice of hot or cold food. The garden view restaurant & terrace had a variety of food & drinks to choose from, we didn't use Saffrons restaurant as we are not fond of spicy food but it was well used by other guests. The cleanliness was excellent ",5
"Good stay thank you. Nice room, friendly staff, excellent pool, yummy breakfast overall a really nice stay. Also good location and nice walk into the town centre. Would stay again, definitely. Thankyou",5
"My partner booked this 3 night stay directly with the hotel. From beginning to end, our week-end was magical, thanks to the absolutely amazing staff and the venue itself. Our room was quite big despite being a standard room, with all the facilities you expect from this class of hotel. Room service was impressive: very friendly reception on the phone, very accommodating and fast: within 3 minutes someone was knocking on our door with exactly what we asked.  The hotel has an impressive 3 food venues. We ate in all 3 and were delighted with the very attentive staff and the delicious food. Special mention to The Saffron restaurant, where we had an amazing 3 course Indian/European meal. The presentation was perfect and flavours out of this world. One of the best meals out I ever had!…",5
Visited here several times before and always have a lovely stay. We have 2 small children and all the staff are so friendly and patient with them. Spotlessly clean and wonderful service. Can't wait to return again.,5
"My husband surprised me with a night away and some spa treatments. I have never felt more relaxed, the treatments were wonderful. Our room was huge and the bed just right, our bathroom was extremely clean and the shower worked perfectly. I would definately recommend this hotel.",5
"The room and its facilities were top class, with the added bonus of being able to admire (from the balcony) the sun from mid-day to sunset. The staff at reception, in the restaurants and at the spa were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. The spa with its pools, sauna and steam room offered us all we needed as far as relaxation was concerned. And the breakfast was top notch.",5
We liked the hotel especially Saffrons.It just seemed to lack atmosphere and no where to lounge if restaurant wasn't open.pool area was very good and treatments ok but expensive. Breakfast was reasonable with plenty of choice buffet style,4
Currently staying on a 4 night break. Cannot fault anything. Location great and have a sea view in the distance. Rooms nice plenty of tea/coffee and cadburys hot chocolate. Just spent a lovely few hours in the spa/pool. You have robes in room so can go down in them. Courtesy bus into town but it's only really a good 10 min walk. Have had snack in the Garden room again excellent. Breakfast in the Orangery very good with plenty of choice and the staff are very attentive.  Free Wifi very good all over the hotel.  Going to hire car tomorrow and drive around the island good rates from the hotel reception and very knowledgeable staff on reception.  Will definitely be our first choice on our next visit.  Thank you for a lovely stay ,5
We stayed at hotel de France for our anniversary and were delighted with hotel. The staff were friendly and always willing to help. The spa is amazing especially the steam room 😎 we had dinner there every night although disappointed that saffrons did not open on a Monday or Tuesday evening as we were looking forward to anniversary meal in slightly luxurious setting. Really cannot fault the hotel would recommend to stay and will definately return again,4
"A lovely hotel with spa. Speciality restaurant and buffet breakfast. Our room was lovely with good views all over St Helier comfortable bed with good sized televisions and nice bathroom   The afternoon was amazing, did not have time to try spa ",5
"Excellent hotel, great value, brilliant staff, lovely food, big breakfast, roomy bedroom with a balcony. Quiet, and relaxing. Will go again, will never find a hotel like that at such a good price here. Enjoyed every minute of our stay.",5
"Lovely hotel, no complaints & would definitely return. Rooms clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Spa is a fantastic place to relax.  Well situated with just a 15 minute walk into the centre of St Helier.",5
"Booked last minute as part of a package deal and was a little sceptical. Had a lovely clean double room, with a view over St Helier and a glimpse of the sea. The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and although we were unable to sample the Saffron restaurant we had two very nice evening meals in the main restaurant. We used the spa/ pool facilities and were very impressed with the layout in this area which was very spacious with lots of loungers for relaxation. All the staff were friendly and very helpful and we couldn't fault anything. An excellent long weekend. ",5
Highly recommended. Made to feel very welcome and staff couldn't do enough to make your stay a pleasant one. Booking transport to printing boarding passes nothing was too much bother. Definately going again. ,5
Great hotel fantastic room get a balcony suite if you can. Goof facilities really good bathroom .breakfast was good though the breakfast room was rather warm. Lesuire facilities really nice. Airport shuttle would have been nice,5
The service from start to finish was excellent with all the Staff being very nice and friendly they could not do enough for us our room was very comfortable would certainly recommend to our friends and family,5
We really enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel De France and would highly recommend it. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. We also had an excellent meal at Saffrons restaurant. The spa facilities are amazing. ,5
"Had a fantastic stay at the Hotel De France, was nice and comfortable to come back to after a hard day excavating. The hotel could benefit from small bar fridges somewhere in the bedrooms, but apart from that it was a beautiful hotel. ",5
We found the hotel excellent. The service was very good staff helpful and the rooms spotless and cleaned quickly every day. The car hire at the hotel was cheap and very good service. The steep access if walking at times could cause problems if you were not good walkers.  ,5
"Service from all the hotel staff was very helpful, The room was very large and had all comforts required, although it was very hot in the part we stayed in and we couldn't turn the heating down in our room. The hotel provides parking and is just a short walk into town, The food is amazing and the spa made our stay relaxing.",4
"The accommodation standard en suite - double bed scenic view, excellent service rivalling most UK 5 star hotels, excellent cleanliness, facility and spa luxury also very quiet. Lovely spacious dining and courteous staff. Definitely stay again...",5
"Got voucher for dinner and overnight stay for Christmas. We up graded to an excuutive room, very comfortable though the decor requires upgrading.  I used the spa facilities while my partner lounged around the pool and sauna. On going back to the room I ask at the spa reception for a extra robe as my partner forgot to bring his from the room. I was 'handled' by a young boy of around 12 years old telling me that the robes where only for the spa users. I explained our situation, that I had used the spa - my partner hadn't. We wanted to go back to the room in our robes. I was met by a blank face and a shrug of the shoulders. My partner had to shower, dry and dress to go back to the room to then get undressed  once back in the room to relax before dinner. Lesson from this - please do…",4
"This my second visit to this hotel and I enjoyed it as much, if not more, than the first.  The staff are delightful - so friendly and helpful.  My husband stays there a lot on business and on the two occasions I have accompanied him I have nothing but praise for the hotel.  I did not have time to use the pool area this time but did eat at the Garden View restaurant twice and enjoyed both meals.  Breakfasts every day were excellent with a great choice of food.  I shall look forward to another visit later in the year.  Highly recommended.",5
"Hotel is in a good condition, both in the old part and the excellent spa rooms. Good view and brilliant spa.  15-20 min walk to town, but shuttle bus exists. Breakfast good but very busy (though it was over easter). Helpful and friendly staff.",4
"Excellent hotel I use on a regular basis Great spa facilities, clean rooms and good food Close enough to town to walk, or sensible priced ride in taxi if needed  I have been coming here on and off since 2008 and always enjoy my stay",5
"Great place to stay. Free parking, great breakfast and a fabulous gym and spa all included in the price. Room was clean and comfortable and it was an easy walk into town. I liked that you could use the spa for the rest of the day even after you had checked out; nice touch!",5
"Hotel and setting was lovely , room and bed was comfy and very clean . The staff were really friendly our only complaint is that they kept running out of fried eggs st breakfast , small complain as food was good quality . Staff were very helpful",5
It is an excellent hotel. The staff are most helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is just a 15 minute walk from the centre of St Helier. The rooms are of average size but with tea/coffee making facilities and all modern facilities. There is also a very good wi fi facility in every room and throughout the hotel. The breakfast is also excellent and is a full English breakfast. ,5
"We had three nights here, the first room we were shown 512 had blinds that didn't work- so we were given an option of two other rooms with. I hesitation which was great. Rooms 128 was very nice and would recommend.  It's a big hotel and a cavernous breakfast room, staff helpful and breakfast was good standard.  The highlight was dinner at Safrons- really excellent food and service and we loved the taster menu. It was beautifully presented on lovely crockery, paced really well and is highly recommend it.  Husband enjoyed all the wines with his taster menu. Didn't use the spa but husband used the gym which has a great range of equipment. ",4
"Fab Hotel with history and character I would give it a 5*. Stayed 4 nights. Good location, walking distance from town, if you like walking. Shuttle bus to pick you up and drop you off through the day, if you so wish. Nice friendly staff, clean spotless rooms, cleaned every day. Supermarket just down the road opened till late. Wish they had some music in the evenings in the restaurant or bar, even if it was just a one man band. Fab public bus service around the island, stops just outside the hotel. Only £2 per person from the airport to the middle of St Hillier's bus station, with plenty of room for your luggage.",5
"It was quite literally a flying visit as I arrived about 9pm and was on my way back to the airport at 5.45am!  That said the check-in staff were very courteous and accommodating, offering room service and wake up calls.  The room was comfortable (once I had worked out how to turn the radiator down) and the bed (a small double) was very conducive to a good nights sleep.  I certainly didn't make the most of what was on offer, and judging by the very positive attitude of the staff (including a genuine ""good morning"" from a cleaner in the lift) it should be a place to spend more time, next time I'm in Jersey.",4
"I have had a brilliant stay at the Hotel De France, staff, room overlooking St Helier super, food, staff great. The spa excellent. Friendly staff very relaxing treatments, not my first or last time. Recommended.",5
"The spa facilities are the best in Jersey and usually quiet especially mid-week.  The hotel itself was good value but the room, although a premium one with lovely view, had a really small double bed which was soft and lumpy,  Not what you would expect in this type of hotel.  Room furnishings a bit uninspiring.  Roller blinds on windows a bit ""bare"". Breakfast average. Potential but room for improvement.",3
"Decided to revisit Jersey after 22 years, lots of hotels to choose from but went for the Hotel De France and was not disappointed. We arrived with friends at around 1.30pm and were told our rooms were available. Our rooms were on the third floor overlooking the town and the sea beyond. The rooms were nicely decorated with a bath and overhead shower. The hotel itself is very opulent with a beautiful staircase and plenty of soft sofas to sit around on. With the centre of town being at least 15 minutes’ walk away we decided to eat both nights in the hotel and were not disappointed. We ate in the Garden View Restaurant where you are able to choose from the evening menu or the all-day menu; this allowed us plenty of choice. The prices were very good and the food cooked to perfection,…",4
"We have stayed here for 4 nights over easter.The hotel is lovely,  comfortable and very clean. Lovely foyer area. Our room was very comfortable,  clean and had great views over St Helier.All the staff are so helpful,and courteous, and a credit to the hotel,  and the food is excellent.  Breakfast has a wide variety to choose from and is all good quality. We dined in the Garden View restaurant each evening, the food was brilliant,  great atmosphere and reasonable prices, the service was exceptional.  If you want to hire a car, I recommend you book, Hertz, via the hotel, it's a great rate, including £1000 excess, and delivered to you at hotel. Apart from a bit of a zig zag walk into town about 20mins. But hotel does run shuttle,  it's a top hotel, and we would definitely stay here…",5
Room was very clean with teat tray and comfortable bed.  View from room over St Helier was great.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was in the top ten of Hotels I have stayed at.  This is my favourite Hotel in Jersey.  I left my washing bag in the hotel this time. I contacted them and they found it and posted it back to me. Great service. Hotel also has free Wifi and parking.,5
We have stayed in this hotel a number of times now and the quality never fails to disappoint. The staff are helpful and efficient. The rooms are very good and comfortable. Breakfast is on a buffet basis which you can choose what you want and return if you want more. The restaurants serve very good food at reasonable prices. Saffrons is different quality and you get what you pay for which is an excellent dining experience. A lot of business people stay here partly because of the conference facilities. The is also a spa which a lot of people use. The hotel is located just on the outskirts of St Helier. About a 15-20 minute walk. If you do not have a car you can use the hotel courtesy bus into to town or the bus station and there are also buses that stop outside the hotel,5
We stayed at hotel de france for 5 nights and loved every minute of it the staff were fantastic the facilities were awesome we ate in the garden restaurant every night the food was excellent! !!!!!!we will definitely go back !!!!,5
From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out the stay was wonderful. The staff in every single department were excellent. Really friendly and very helpful. Delightful breakfasts and meals in the various restaurants in the hotel.,5
"Very helpful and friendly staff from the moment we arrived. Lovely clean and comfortable room with great veiw over St Helier to the sea. Excellent spar facilities which we used every day. Could not fault the food. Good choice, value and quality in the Terrace Restaurant. Did not try the Saffron restaurant as we felt it was too expensive. Overall a first class hotel.",5
Had an amazing overnight stay. Staff were wonderful. Very helpful and friendly. The spa facilities were very relaxing and very clean. Could not fault this at all. Rooms were also spotless. Would definitely be back to stay again ,5
"Opportunity not to be missed, staff in the hotel and spa and restaurant from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave. Experience is second to none. We love it there and return on numerous occasions and we live in jersey ",5
"This is our second visit to this hotel,it won't be our last! The staff, accommodation breakfast and spa/pool are faultless. The hotel is in an ideal location with about a twenty minute walk into the town centre. The hotel also offers a free shuttle if you don't fancy the walk! Also ample parking. We hired a car to get around but always walked when going to the town centre.",5
"only downside was that saffron was having a bad night, meal average, then the bill got mixed up with other tables, took awhile to sort it out. this does not reflect on the hotel, will return to he hotel but not to saffron",5
I have used this hotel for 3 years and quite often the service of the staff is excellent although not always.   However on my most recent trip they moved my room at short notice which was much appreciated.,4
"I booked an executive suite, but there was not enough drawers and I could not open both doors of the wardrobe as the bedside cabinet got in the way.  The spa area was very inviting and the staff on duty were very friendly.  The quality of food in the Garden Terrace was good.",4
"Excellent and good value, although limiting access because of location.  Very good breakfast.  Room maid  service was variable.  Two days the room was fully made-up. On two days there was very limited work carried out",4
Excellent room breakfast staff bit of hike the town but enjoyed the pool and spa Great for couples and adults. Not sure about children as we didn't have one but I m sure they would love the pool. But if hike up the hill so not recommended if difficulty walking or disabled,4
"Such a good time and excellent staff,  really good facilities and very helpful staff. Would definitely visit again and be happy to recommend them.  a lovely room and slept so well, like being at home.  Thank you ",5
"Excellent service and amenities. A comfortable and enjoyable experience. The shuttle bus proved a real asset as the hotel is a little out of the centre but that was its only drawback and not one that should affect you choosing this lovely hotel as the base for your Jersey holiday. The breakfast was varied, plentiful and tasty and we very much appreciated the quality and standard of the in-house restaurant, Saffron.",5
This is an elegant hotel situated about a ten minute walk from the centre of St Hellier. If you have any disability it would be difficult to approach due to its hillside location and the stairs that lead to the hotel from the street. The hotel does have a mini bus service at scheduled times. The rooms are well appointed and our spa room could not be faulted. The Leisure facility of pools and sauna and steam room are also of a high standard. We dined in the hotel on a numberof occasions and found the food to be of a good standard but the service differed depending on the number of people dining and a long wait between courses was one of the annoyances. The hotel breakfast has a good variety of foodstuffs on offer but the batch cooking of some of the food could be improved with…,4
"Cannot find anything to complain about. Hotel was lovely, rooms average size but very comfortable and very clean. Breakfast was included and was excellent, really enjoyed the food. Plenty of choice and more than enough. Spa was also great. Would definitely recommend.",5
"Nice building and facenating rooms and pools. Good restaurant and service. Tricky to find breakfast, more signs would be usefull. Nevertheless the breakfast was really good. To drive from the hotel took more time than we expected due to the traffic, but the place is ok.",4
"What a fabulous hotel, the food,staff and room were excellent . We had an absolutely superb time. the spa was excellent aswell and all the staff were very courteous, friendly and very helpful ,could not fault it at all. We had a full week there.",5
"Booked in here for a business trip as really handy for town centre and good restaurants nearby. The spa is fantastic and great to wind down, only complaint is while robes are supplied you need to buy slippers from the shop! Lovely breakfast buffet, good price in the bars and relaxing lounges. All the staff were charming.... Would definitely return",4
"Booked last minute,wanted a bath as I don't have one, was bliss plus the spa extra bonus and the breakfast! Plus being local was easy for work !👍🏻 so had room service on the Monday! Then went to work",5
"Perfect for weekend getaway, you can also make use of their very nice spa. Breakfast was good with lots of different things to eat. Would definitely recommended for couples or a weekend with friends. It's only a short walk to the center, 10/15 mins. ",5
"Friendly staff, great room fortunate enough to have had a room overlooking the town of St Helier,great pool facilities,food and service of a very high standard a very enjoyable stay.Thanks to all concerned for your professional service and value for money on our overnight stay.",5
We booked this hotel based on previous trip advice reviews and its current rating.  The hotel is huge and imposing but a lot of that is lost as it's very much hidden from the road by the ugly office building and car park that has been built in front of it.  The hotel is approximately a 15 minute walk from the bus station and the main shopping streets of St Helier.  We were slightly disappointed with the size and decor of our room but it offered the amenities of a good 4* star hotel we are accustomed to.  The hotel is so large you can easily get lost in the maze of corridors. The decor of the entire hotel is rather dated but it's very clean and well looked after.  The reception staff are very welcoming and helpful. They kindly printed our boarding passes for our journey home. …,4
"Have stayed before and do enjoy the gym,  spa and pool facilities. Rooms are perfectly adequate for an overnight stay, This time as it was Tuesday night Indian restaurant wasn't open which was  a shame as it is superb",4
"The hotel was very pleasant, though rather quiet during a damp February.  Staff were friendly and helpful, and the pool area excellent.  Breakfast was very good - though the room where it was served was rather gloomy.",4
The hotel was very comfortable and clean.Rooms and bathrooms very spacious. The hotel staff very friendly and breakfast to die for.Would love to go back but will choose the summer months because not much on the island was open.,5
"We upgraded to a ""Spa room"" which is in the newer part of the hotel. The room is much larger and better presented than the standard room, although the bed seems to be the same size so there is a lot of empty space - still well worth the extra, with a nice bathroom and shower. The Garden View brasserie is nice if you don't feel like heading out, and the staff very friendly. If you plan to use the spa itself then you will probably need to book before you arrive. Breakfast is excellent, the staff attentive without pestering, and car parking easy although a little snug if you come with a big car. It's a 10-15 minute walk into the main part of town, and in the evening a taxi cost us less than £5.",4
"This was a pleasant hotel to stay in from the get go. Other than hanging about for our room to be available it was great. The room we were given had a fantastic view and balcony. Our one grievance with that was that it was next to stair well and was glass so you could see into our room if people were going past didn't bother us as the hotel was quite but considering price of our room it was something that we both agreed would rethink if we're to visit Jersey again, something hotel should consider maybe frosting the window on stairwell to give us privacy.  The dla area and pool was clean and just what we needed to relax. The hotel arranged for hire car rep to come and sort a car out for us which was quick and at a price we were happy with cheaper than there taxi. Might return…",5
"We stayed here in February for 5 nights while visiting Jersey for a wedding.  The hotel is excellent with lots of amenities and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly .  We ate most nights in the Garden View Restaurant and the choice of food was just right.  I am very fussy when it comes to steak (very well done) and on the 2 occasions I had it, it was cooked to perfection!  The breakfast choices were amazing, you certainly didn't leave the hotel hungry!  I would definitely recommend this hotel and if we manage another visit to Jersey, we would stay here!",5
"We stayed at Hotel de France for our first visit to Jersey in July 2015.  We booked a spa room because it had a walk in shower.  The room was very large with a small balcony and we could just see the sea from it.  The bed was large and comfortable.  The bathroom was nice with a normal bath within a wet room.  The floor was slippery when you had a shower so we had to be careful and put a towel down on the floor to ensure we didn't slip.  We were there on a half board basis.  This gave us a set amount of money to spend each night in the garden view restaurant, the food was cooked and presented beautifully, however the menu didn't change for the whole week we stayed there and as my husband is vegetarian he didn't have much of a choice and ended up having the same meal three times.…",3
We stayed here for 5 nights. The spa and swimming pool are fantastic. The reception in the hotel and the pool are very friendly and helpful. We have food in both restaurant and they are amazing. Breakfast are great. They have soya milk as well as normal milk for breakfast which I don't normally find in most restaurants I have stayed. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this to anyone ,5
"We stayed here as a small group of ten to celebrate an 80th birthday. From the outset Adele and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating to the differing needs of the family group. Two were upgraded to spa rooms (really lovely) so that mobility needs could be met. Even the standard rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Ours was dual aspect and very spacious with views across town. Breakfast is fresh, varied and delicious with so much to choose from that all ages were kept happy. Staff were attentive and helpful and checking the breakfast buffet very regularly to ensure it was kept stocked up. The pool and spa are fabulous and those who used the gym were very happy with the facilities. Our celebration meal in the restaurant was great too and the adjacent bar…",5
"I sent my sister here for a surprise 50th Birthday treat. Wowza! I arranged for a few extra's with the Hotel Reservations Dionne Brittan. Her professionalism and quality of service was second to none. Dionne managed to arrange all my requests of which one was outside the Hotels normal extra's. (50 balloons in my Sister's room, all pink all different sizes) whilst she was in the hotel Spa. The Reception staff helped by blowing up all 50 balloons (amazing) thank you guys. My Sister was so Surprised. I asked for a Birthday Cake and a joke to be presented at her evening meal, another surprise, all done not a problem.  Ayush Wellness Spa. at the Hotel - Marius also helped and arranged my sisters surprise Spa Day. Marius recommended a package. Thank you Marius she absolutely loved it…",5
" We booked this Hotel for a Valentines weekend as we were celebrating 25 years together.T What a nice surprise to have received a bottle of complementary  Prosecco and fruit bowl, together with a beautiful bedroom. This Hotel takes some beating for great Staff, Food, Spa and comfortable bedrooms. I would recommend this Hotel to friends and family. We are hoping to return in May 2016!!!!!!",5
"We Are greatful  for our 3nights. We spend lovely times in beautiful hotel ,lovely breakfast , with helpful staff. We are happy Specially  appreciate from (Ms Andreea❤️ & dear Mr Bogdan )they Are so kind & reaaly nice 💐 Thank you and we hope to  see you again very  soon .",4
We liked the swimming pool but the massage was really disappointing and was not absolutely relaxing.  The window of the room was too small and very complicated to open.  The breakfast was really good. The parking is very eady and very close to the hotel. You really need a car in this aera.,4
"Large, comfortable, luxury hotel close to St Helier with very helpful and friendly staff. Great facilities - 2 restaurants & separate large breakfast room; spa with indoor pool; hairdresser; ample parking including multi storey. ",5
"We are a family of four with children 6 & 3 and stayed in standard adjoining rooms (double and twin). We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the standard rooms. The breakfast was fantastic. The kids really enjoyed the swimming pool and spa has a very luxurious feel - everywhere was well presented & clean. We booked the HdF on value, but were really pleasantly surprised by the quality and welcome we received. Thank you.",5
"Great location for St. Helier and a wonderful hotel.  Pool and spa amenities were fabulous (big towels and lovely changing rooms).  Lovely bar (Saffrons) and bright and airy garden view restaurant. Breakfast was very good - excellent choice and very good cooked breakfast.  None of us felt hungry! The only minus point was the windowless breakfast room.  Not a really bad point but there were curtains across the connecting opening to a much nicer looking room with roof lanterns and generous glazing.  The staff were all great, the rooms nice and big and very well lit.  Very comfortable beds and lovely hot showers.  Free parking was great but if you're not looking to explore the island there was a free bus into town, or it was a nice 10 minute walk.",5
I'm sure there are excellent and modern rooms in this good looking hotel but mine wasn't one of them. Poor room lighting and old bathroom fittings. And indifferent heating. However the concierge Tony could not have been more helpful. So average. ,3
"I stayed here for a couple of nights mid-week with my husband. The room was lovely, spacious, comfy and with a great view. The bathroom was equally lovely. We were in 212 a spa room.   We had breakfast both days and found the food to be great quality, lots of choice, etc. We also had lunch in the garden view restaurant- this was again really nice food, fresh and lots of choice (I'm a vegetarian so this is rare!). The bar served some great late night cocktails too!   We used the spa facilities during our stay, which was lovely. The spa was clean and there were plenty of loungers. The only disappointment of the stay was that despite being in a spa room at a spa hotel, we were unable to book any spa treatments! They were fully booked the entire duration of our midweek stay, not the…",4
"I planned a surprise night at the hotel for my wife. She was absolutely thrilled with the Spa room. The taster menu at Saffrons was superb, the service was excellent and the staff were very knowledgeable about the food and wine. We would thoroughly recommend the Hotel and restaurant",5
"Always friendly all staff polite, spa lovely, very quiet. Will be using this hotel again in the future. Breakfast was fab, too much choice, - afternoon tea again wonderful, only thing we didn't use was the restaurant as it was closed ""Saffrons"".  ",5
This is a fabulous hotel which we absolutely loved! The food was brilliant with lovely fresh vegetables and quality meats! Presentation was great and generous portions! The staff are the friendliest and most helpful we have ever come accross! 100% recommended! Only think not spot on was the beds and pillows which really could do with improving! ,5
"On my stay at the hotel de France,  I can have no complaints. Staff were friendly,  hotel was meticulously clean with all the facilities you could wish for, all at a very reasonable price. I would not hesitate to stay there again. ",4
"This was our first visit to Jersey, and we chose the Hotel De France based on it's location above the town and the gorgeous frontage. The staff were extremely helpful and informative and the main body of the hotel is very attractive . However, we were staying in the Spa wing and the rooms here are a little bizarre. They are large and sparsely furnished, leaving large spaces in the room meaning that it felt like you were staying in a waiting room.  The finishing touches were not great (bath taps not in line with each other, wooden panelling not aligned) but the walk in shower was very good.  The breakfast and the food was really good, but the Garden View restaurant was open and lacked any atmosphere or ambience (as did the Lounge Bar) . The Saffron restaurant was  closed which…",3
Staff from Reception to spa v friendly welcoming professional - room was nothing to write home about Breakfast was average - lots of choice but quality so so.. Staff again most helpful cheerful and obliging,4
"Stayed here for valentines and it was just perfect. Breakfast was gorgeous loads to choose from. Had a full body massage which was amazing just what I needed. Had a meal at saffrons which was the best meal I have had. Food was outstanding. The swimming pools were gorgeous. Infinity pool to swim in, a smaller massage pool, a plunge pool which is very very cold! Finish off by relaxing in the hot pool just gorgeous. Large sauna and steam room. Perfect weekend!",5
"Took wife for her birthday. Brilliant!! Upgraded to Spa room. Well worth the extra money. Great meal at night, great room and relaxing day in spa. Missed out on her massage as fully booked but more my fault . Too late booking ",5
"Good solid old school hotel moving in the right direction with the Saffrons Restaurant and the Spa and gym facilities; I hope it is sustainable! Very helpful staff who directed us to food after a late arrival at the hotel-just in time to have a really good meal in the garden restaurant. The breakfast was probably too good for our needs, it would have been useful to be able to leave it and spend more time exploring! The actual bedroom was sufficient rather than luxurious but the rest of the facilities made up for it!",5
"Before I begin singing my praises for Hotel de France, I have to thank Shona (on the events team) that helped me organise the Spa Hen Weekend for my best friend. I would also like to thank all the staff that served us, including (and with special thanks to) the Chef at Saffrons that cooked some of the most exquisite Indian food we have ever tasted.   Our itinerary consisted of afternoon tea, access to the spa and then dinner.  The afternoon tea was lovely, with the usual finger sandwiches and sweet treats. The restaurant had a welcoming atmosphere and a pretty view of the gardens (despite the rain). The spa was definitely relaxing with a pool, a good size jacuzzi, a small pool with hot water and another filled with cold water. The steam room and the sauna were also excellent…",5
"Very lovely hotel, pleasant staff in all areas. Pool area very nice, rooms large and spacious and very clean. Breakfast selection very good. Very speedy check in all paper work was ready and waiting as we didn't arrive until the evening. Within easy walking distance to town centre about a 10 min walk slightly down hill so up hill coming back .came home relax and refreshed after a lovely long weekend.",5
"Despite staying in the off-season, the breakfast was excellent as were the pool and spa and the staff. We only booked a standard room, but it was very clean and comfortable. 15 minute walk into the town centre, but the hotel provided a timetabled shuttle service if required.",4
"My wife and I spent 4 nights here as part of our Golden wedding celebrations having previously holidayed there in 1969!! What an inspired choice! The service was exceptional from the time we arrived until departure. The staff were brilliant always enthusiastic and helpful. The Spa room was luxurious and the Ayush Wellness Spa the best we have experienced.The days island tour organised by the hotel via Waverley Tours was fantastic and went ahead even though we were the only customers.The location, although not scenic ,was within walking distance of the shopping centre and excellent museum. The bus stopped outside the hotel and again the service round the island good. You can survive without a car! The airport pickup by Tantivy tours was on time and the driver very helpful. Coming…",5
"Treated my sister to an overnight stay for her birthday. I wasn't disappointed! What a lovely hotel with a great spa, lovely relaxing pool and very clean. Paid extra for an upgrade on the room and it was well worth it as we had great views, a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi bath and twin basins. We also had a separate dressing room! The food was lovely and the staff were very friendly and attentive.! LOOKING FORWARD TO RETURNING IN THE FUTURE ",5
"Super hotel, great service, nice breakfast and comfy beds. A ten minute walk into town. Nice spa and tasty Liberation Ale. The rooms were of a decent size and clean. The shower was brilliant. Highly recommended.",5
"I had a 2 night stay for business, choose this hotel due to the pool and gym. Didnt get to use the gym but pool was very good and the sanua etc. Only down side food wasnt great in the bar but i understand the other facilities open up later in the year. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",4
From the moment of booking to checking out nothing was to much trouble friendly kind Curtiss staff a joy to see after myself working in the same industry for 20 years was a pleasure to be there.  The hotel is very professional in an unobtrusive way efficient service coupled with a welcoming manor a winning combination,5
Me my partner and my 4 year old daughter (we in are 30s)visited here for a week the staff are frIendly  the rooms are really clean the spa is amazing good place to visit if you need to relax. I would recommend a renting a car nothing against the hotel just best way to enjoy the island ,4
"Very enjoyable afternoon/overnight stay - Garden Room restaurant food is very nice, all the staff are friendly and the spa is awesome for relaxing.  Personally, we prefer the normal double rooms over the spa rooms.",5
Staff were great but our room (a twin) was really small and outdated. In honesty for an overnight stay it is overpriced. The coffee at breakfast was not nice and there was egg shell in my scrambled egg. I was disappointed. The Ayush spa however was amazing. ,3
"I stayed at Hotel De France last weekend with my boyfriend for his 28th birthday.  As I made the booking I informed the staff at the hotel that I am a vegan, and asked whether or not they would be able to provide any vegan options for me for dinner and breakfast.  They were more than happy to accommodate me and were very happy to talk me through the menu. This made me feel very welcome and catered for as most places you eat out at can be a nightmare for different dietary requirements.  I will definitely be returning again to Hotel De France.",5
Excellent hotel very professionally run .great value for money health spa sauna steam jacuzzi & swimming pool all working . Excellent breakfast & shuttle service drop & pickup service available free  .all for £103.00 a night through the winter and that's a health spa room with balcony with beautiful views of jersey .  Perfect 5 star accommodation set in beautiful surroundings .,5
"Fifth time at this hotel whilst working on Jersey and have to say it's been the best visit so far, on arrival I was upgraded to a Spa Room, which is very spacious with large bath and walk in shower. Good views over St.Helier from room which has it's own balcony. Only downside with view is it looks down on the roof of the spa. The food in the Garden View Restaurant has I believe improved a lot from last year, didn't have a bad meal in the three nights I was there. Staff are superb throughout hotel, highly recommended!",5
"I often organise conferences and events in Jersey and would recommend Hotel de France to anyone.   The events staff, Shona and Adele, are great. They have fantastic attention to detail and always meet our needs.  The catering and F&B staff are always very helpful and they are always available on the day to assist where needed.   We look forward to holding more events at Hotel de France.",5
"This hotel was ideal for a short break with friends.   Nice distance from centre and beaches if you like a short walk.  Staff were pleasant and accomodating, room was fine and the price was reasonable.  Lovely spa and pool area and any food we had was good.",4
i have just stayed here for a quick one night stop over and found it a comfortable place. its clean and the shower was good and bed was comfy. its not in the centre of town though so its about 10-15 mins walk from the shops/restaurants and bus station so i would reccomend you get taxis to and from the airport. it wasnt convenient enough for me.,4
"I really couldn't have wished to stay in a better hotel for my 25th birthday and my first visit to Jersey.   The building itself is quite high up and being on the fourth floor we had a great view of St Helier and the sea, it's very beautiful at night.  The interior of the hotel has a classic charm about it, you are greeted with a large spiral stair case when you first enter and the décor gives the hotel a luxurious and comfortable feel.  Our room, which was a standard twin room was clean and fresh with beautiful floor to ceiling windows. With tea making facilities, spacious wardrobe, safe, coffee table and chairs and T.V. with a couple of Sky channels. The beds were also very comfortable.  The bathroom was amazing, simple blue and white tiles and bright lighting made it very…",5
"The hotel has a prominent position, and I'm sure upper floors get great views, from the premium room (guaranteed front of hotel and walk in shower), but on only second floor the view was mostly across the flat roof of the spa below.  The room was average at best, really dull and uninspired décor, basic furniture, but a good size and clean etc.  Breakfast was similarly uninspired, but functional.  Overall the hotel looks good on the outside, but just devoid of character inside.",3
We chose to stay in the Hotel De France because it appeared to have the best overall reputation. Also we wanted to be near to S4 Helier center but notvactually in it. The accomodation was spotless and as it was our 45th wedding anniversary we were greeted with a very nice unexpected welcome gift of flowers fruit and proseco. Although we only had breakfasts these top quality and generous buffet style but there was always plenty of staff there to get anything you might want.  Overall the place was spotlessly clean and had a very calm atmosphere.  The spa pool and gyms which was all inside was brilliant and well staffed with efficient and caring people. On the down side one might feel that bar meal and the restraunt were overpriced but the restrants in St Helier are many and at a…,5
"This was the first time my husband stayed at the hotel as I've been a few times with work.  The staff throughout the hotel are incredibly helpful and friendly.  We checked in and had time for a quick drink the cocktail bar before heading out for a work function.  The next day was very much spent relaxing in the idyllic Ayush spa.  We enjoyed it so much we've already booked another trip.  A fabulous pool, steam room, sauna, plunge pool, massage pool and relaxing treatment packages mean you can easily spend a few hours here.  There's also a range of healthy juices and smoothies available for you to choose from.  I'm looking forward to my next visit where we plan to make the most of the treatments.",5
The hotel was nice but it is the staff who shine .  I've been to a lot of hotels on business but the staff here are amongst the friendliest and helpful I've ever experienced. Thanks to all. Will be back,5
"Very nice hotel , staff polite and helpful, spa swimming pool excellent, massage very good. Breakfast varied and hot, dinner menu good, not extensive, little bit pricey. Courtesy car to town brilliant idea, plus pick up ",4
"Hotel very good in both accommodation  and service. The three course meal on evening of arriving was excellent however, we had two of the ""All Day"" meals on following evenings as not very hungry and we can only describe them as poor and not up to 4 star standard by any means. They could not possibly have been cooked by the same 'chef'.  ",4
"We stayed here for several days. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The food is delicious in both Saffrons and The Garden View restaurant. The spa is fantastic and a real luxury feature with a warm main pool, spa pool with jacuzzi as well as a hot bath and cold plunge. There are plenty of sun loungers - inside or outside. In addition you can take a relaxing massage! Our room was exceptionally quiet. The breakfast has a great variety of choice. It is so good we came back again later in the year and I would recommend this to anyone travelling to Jersey.",5
Only stayed 2 nights but very pleased with hotel and breakfast. Sadly did not use Gym or swimming pool but did look and appeared to be very good. Room was clean and bed comfy and room was serviced whilst we were out.,5
"Stayed just one night.Had a lovely room overlooking the town and the pool area.Did request when I booked that I didn't want to face a brick wall,which happened to a friend of mine when she stayed here.Had a really good meal and the service was excellent.Finished off in the bar for a relaxing nightcap to end a most enjoyable evening.Will most definitely stay here again.",5
"Excellent stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. the room was good and the food excellent, the plaice served as a special in the restaurant was as good as I have ever tasted I really enjoyed the pool and the other facilities. ",5
"We had an amazing overnight stay. Room was a great size, heated floor in the bathroom was a nice surprise. Really peaceful. Spa is very relaxing and spacious. We had dinner in Saffrons, and the food was incredible. Definitely recommend the tasting menu. Can't wait to book in again!",5
"We arrived at this hotel around 9am and even though we were not due to check in until 2pm, we were still given a room. The no so good thing was that the room was absoloutley freezing to a point where the bed felt so cold even by putting your hand on it. But we were given another room within the next half hour and we were much more comfortable. Feom this point we had no other problems. We had a beautiful stay, the girl at reception Claudia was really kind and she explained everything to us about what we could do around the area also. A day later Claudia and her colleague arranged oir room for us as it was my partners birthday and it was done up beautiful with very nice balloon decoration that they even supplied themselves. I must say it was a very pleasant stay and we are very…",4
"Second time I have stayed at hotel de France,for personal reasons its perfectly located position..a superb hotel,lovely room,staff brilliant,what more can I say...excellent breakfast,as much as you can eat.",5
"The Hotel de France could not have improved. Literally everything had been thought about. The staff were helpful and cheerful. The food was delicious and plentiful. We had a spa room which wanted for nothing. Lovely deep bath, massive walk in shower. Toiletries always topped up and fresh towels. They'd even thought of the little things like the hairdryer having a long lead and the plug being near a mirror - one of my usual bugbears in a hotel. The swimming pool complex was so wonderful, it was impossible not to relax. We were able to borrow an umbrella to walk into town one rainy evening, and the receptionist even printed off our boarding passes for the airport on the morning of our departure. We honestly couldn't fault it and will definitely be making a return journey.",5
"3 night break was all we wished for on a windy November weekend. Used the Spa everyday which was warm and relaxing. Facilities at the hotel were very good and breakfast covered all our needs. The reception staff were very helpful ordering taxis and printing our boarding passes for our flight home. The free wifi extended to all parts of the hotel. We had a Spa room (206} which had magnificent views over the town down to the beach. It's only a 10-15 min walk to the town centre which has all the usual restaurants you would expect. We found the bars really old school filled by locals and visitors alike, no music or televisions, just people out for a good time. I digress from the hotel but thought worth mentioning. We will be back.  ",5
Stayed at hotel in October . Not an ideal location long walk from st Helier shops etc. Not ideally suited to anyone with walking difficulties as there are lots & lots of steap steps leading up to hotel,3
"A really good stay - pool and spa excellent and had an excellent meal at Saffrons restaurant in the hotel. The only thing - the room was draughty and we were a little cold despite the central heating. In fairness it was blowing a gale outside, but it did take the edge off what otherwise would have been an even more enjoyable stay. ",4
"We spent four nights in this large hotel. The room was a great size, bright and clean. The breakfast was delicious. The spa wonderful,and the massage was very relaxing. The food in the resurgent near the spa was great as was the service. It's a short walk into town. We got a taxi to and from the airport, Robert the kindly Parisian driver was wonderful.",5
We spent a very nice trip in a lovely hotel. This place is very comfortable and beautiful equipped with a splendid spa area. I would advise parents to go to this hotel without their children. Besides It was the first time I had seen such a varied breakfast...Excellent. Thank you.,4
"From the welcome on arrival to the efficiency of my check out, the standard of service was uniformly high. I have stayed elsewhere in Jersey previously, but am now unlikely to choose anywhere else. All the staff were friendly and helpful and meant that my stay was most enjoyable. The breakfasts were particularly enjoyable with very wide choice and excellent cooking. ",5
"This is an excellent quality hotel with very friendly and welcoming staff throughout.  All areas are tastefully decorated to a very high standard, I cannot recall staying in a cleaner hotel.  The food was excellent in all 3 restaurants.  We stayed on a B&B basis and found the selection for breakfast in the Orangery Restaurant wide and varied and more than enough for most people - the poached eggs were to die for!  Our celebratory ruby wedding anniversary meal in the specialist Saffrons Restaurant was excellent.  We ate twice in the Garden View Restaurant where the quality was again high and the portions generous.  The Ayusha Wellness Spa was well equipped, with a gym, and good sized swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi together with a large range of additional beauty…",5
Stayed here for 1 night in June before moving to another hotel. I wish we had stayed here longer. Lovely hotel and great location. We had a room in the eaves of the roof which gave great views to the surroundings. Buffet breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel! Definitely worth the money at this hotel. Would look to stay here again if visited Jersey again,5
"Excellent enjoyed everything about it would definitely love to stay again and would recommend to all. First time in Jersey. Was a great stay. Loved the pool, bar and room - highlight of trip was meeting Nigel man sell",5
"Located about a 10 minute walk from the centre of St Helier this hotel provided an excellent location for the two couples in my group. We had adjoining rooms with balconies looking over the town. Very nice (apart from the weather!). Rooms were well appointed, with excellent baths and separate rain showers (heated bathroom floor was nice on the feet after a hard day being a tourist). Hotel itself was large and grand and the spa/leisure facilities were excellent with large pools, Jacuzzis, steam and sauna rooms etc. Break fast was delicious, I recommend the smoked haddock with poached eggs but the buffet was very well presented also. Staff all lovely and friendly. I would definitely book into here again on return. When you do arrive, buy a bus pass, best mode of transport and will…",4
A friend booked me a treatment and can't believe it has taken me so long to use the facilities. I look forward to my next treatment which won't be too far away and relax by the pool before it. Thank you,5
"The hotel was excellent in everything; the bedrooms were tastefully decorated; the food was excellent, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  I cannot wait to go back again. The swimming pool and spa are to relaxing.  It is a short walk into the town centre, which was great",4
"The spa and swimming pools are fantastic, such a relaxing place to unwind, the hotel and spa staff are all very friendly and helpful and my overall hotel experience was fantastic. We can't wait to go back.",5
"Had a weekend here with my wife, what can you say!! Amazing.. The complementary use of the pool area was fab!! Excellent buffet breakfast, staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for you.. Will stay here on my next visit to Jersey  Was only a short 10 min walk to St Helier and we paid around £6 for a taxi back to the hotel after a night on the tiles...  Would recommend. ",5
"Everything about our week in this Hotel was excellent, from the moment we arrived to when we left. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The food was exceptional, such good quality. Having booked Bed and breakfast, we in fact had an evening meal each evening we were there. The spa facilities were second to none, enjoyed every minute, we look forward to going back sometime. We returned home totally chilled out,ummmmm lovely!! Thank you to all in the Hotel De France.",5
" A great hotel ,  really friendly and helpful staff, outstanding pool and spa facilities . A Fabulous breakfast buffet  with plenty of choice for vegetarians too..Thoroughly enjoyable and I would return.",5
"We been to the Hotel de France approximately 20 times over the last 11 years and every time we've been welcomed back like old friends.  The service is discrete, attentive and friendly.  Accommodation standards are excellent and we will keep returning every 6 months.",5
"We absolutely love the hotel de France - we return year after year. Top class rooms, staff, service, value,location, food and facilities. Our 5th visit in 9 years - and more t come we hope😀 the shuttle bus to town service was much appreciated. The spa facilities Are so relaxing",5
We were looking for a relaxing mini break and Hotel de France just fitted the bill.  Very clean.  Relaxing atmosphere with excellent spa facilities. Would definitely book again. Staff all very freindly and helpful,5
"I would definitely  recommend this hotel. I have enjoyed a short stay. The service was very pleasant , very friendly staff. Great facilities - clean spa, many restaurants. Prices are reasonable, My only concern is the size of the room , quite small but very cosy.  ",5
"The Hotel is the perfect hotel for a business trip. The rooms are comfortable, the staff are all very helpful and pleasant and the location is perfect for getting in to St Helier. I would recommend and stay again.",4
Went for the spa reviver package on a Friday evening straight from work. Really helpful staff when booking and during our stay. We were running late for our booked spa treatments but no stress from the hotel staff at all. Perfect overnight stay!,5
"I have stayed here several times. I love the spacious spa rooms with their view over St Helier, and always enjoy the pool and spa facilities. A relaxing and very comfortable place to stay. Slightly out of town but this is not a problem. ",4
Don't make a mistake I work on the Island 3 X a year each stay 4 days for the last 26 years the hotel is the best.  Gemma on the reception will look after you what ever you need really lovely lady.  If you want to see the island and enjoy  Jersey go to the Hotel De France you will have a brilliant time use the spar best in the UK. ,5
"It is an excellent hotel, located in a beautiful place just 10 minutes walk from the centre of the city ( st. Helier). Very comfortable rooms, excellent room service, nice restaurants, in doors swimming pool,  sauna, gym. The staff is very friendly and polite and breakfast is great!!!",5
"We visited Jersey from 27th October 2015 to 31st October 2015 and stayed at the Hotel De France. The staff at the check in desk were very friendly and welcoming which is always a good sign. As we had arrived early our cases were taken care of ahead of being delivered to our room which was not quite ready. It was after all only 10am. Everything was fully explained to us, i.e., what time breakfast was and where to find the breakfast room and all other bars and restaurants that were available to us. The room became available within the hour which was great. There is a shuttle bus to St Helier at various times during the day if you don’t want to walk. It only takes 10 to 15 minutes anyway. The room was excellent and had a balcony which overlooks St Helier, probably great to enjoy a…",5
"Just back from a week-end trip to Jersey, staying a the Hotel de France. A lovely hotel perfect for relaxing with friends. What struck me most was how cheerful helpful and professional the hotel staff were, especially those on reception. They are some of the friendliest hotel staff we have come across. The food was great and the rooms comfortable and clean. The spa is superb! Would definitely stay here again. ",5
"We spent 2 days and a night in Jersey for shopping and generally a relaxing time. We travelled from the sister Island of Guernsey. After checking many hotels and Guest Houses I looked at the Hotel De France. I called them and told them my requirement's. They were very helpful and offered a Junior suite with free Wi-Fi, Parking, breakfast for 2 and full use of the Spa facilities for 2 days. All in £115 for 2 of us. The Hotel is beautiful, a little out of town but a nice walk in and a £5 taxi ride back with your shopping bags! The staff were very obliging and professional at all times which really does make your stay worth it when staff go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Exceptionally clean magnificent room on the top floor with a panoramic view of St. Helier only slight…",5
"Only have one complaint and that's the lack of a decent bar. One is very cafe foody feel and the other really posh with limited opening that feels more like reception to the main restaurant. Otherwise great. Helpful staff, good breakfast, bus into town which is an easy walk anyway, fantastic spa and comfortable room. ",4
"The best thing about this hotel is the service, from the moment you walk throught the door all the staff are perfect. The hotel is very spacious, clean and well looked after. The spa meets the same standards, the only problem being the presence of children who dont respect the serenity of the surroundings which is a shame. ",5
"Lovely hotel, helpful friendly staff. Very clean everywhere. Hotel up on a hill not suitable for everyone, the complimentary bus was never running when we needed it at the times we went out.. Enjoyed the walk.  Couldn't fault it. ",5
"Very nice hotel.  Could be thought of as being a little out of town for some people but for us it was perfect. Courtesy bus too and from St Helier if you don't fancy the walk.  Hotel room was very clean and very comfortable. Food in the restaurant was superb, breakfast excellent and the staff were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and I would go back if I visit Jersey again.",4
"We had a lovely break at Hotel De France, superb treatments and great food. . Friendly staff, very good service. . It is very good place to stay even just for one night, doesn't matter what weather is I amight sure we can find something to do. . Thank you very much for lovely time. . ",5
Only stayed one night. Staff very helpful and room clean. Breakfast was ok although my friend had the full English which was only luke warm. Nice building but a bit steep if walking back to hotel from town if not too good on your feet.  I would stay again if in the area.,3
"I've been Jersey for holiday with frd and stayed in Hotel de France for 4 nights. The staffs are nice and kind, the spa center is perfect. Room is clean but just a little bit old. Overall it's worthwhile.",5
"Breakfast at the Hotel de France was good, lots of choice to suit every taste but unfortunately the cooked food was only barely warm. Service was good. The restaurants on site were both expensive.  We used the Garden View Restaurant twice but were not impressed.  Fish and chips were good, burger nothing special, chicken was overcooked so dry and tough.  Food was not very hot. Service was certainly not swift. We would have liked more choice on the menu and a variety of prices, expensive for a family. We did eat at the nearby Monterey Hotel one evening and found it to be much better value, much better quality of food and excellent service. But generally we found the hotel staff very curteous and friendly and the standard of cleanliness was good.  Spa was also very good. ",4
"Great hotel. Staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. Well appointed, very clean and good facilities. only 20/25 minutes walk from town centre. Only slight drawback is the short walk from the road (75 meters) up cardiac hill!",5
Excellent hotel and staff. Superb spa and gym.  Food was really good except for one meal which was very poor. No reason given for this. Location of hotel not brilliant and a week in St Helier is much too long in autumn,4
The hotel is big but seems very dated and looks as it needs a lot of money spent on it.   The rooms are below what I would say we paid. £90 for one night with a shower that looks like this is sub standard and poor.   I don't like being ripped off and I've stayed at better hotels for lower rates.   ,1
"A beautiful and spotlessly clean traditional hotel with modern facilities. A friendly welcome and excellent, helpful staff with nothing too much trouble.  Breakfast is phenomenal. Will definitely be back.",5
"We stayed at the Hotel de France in October. Reception staff - Faye had excellent customer service, very welcoming and friendly.  The rooms were very clean. The garden/breakfast restaurants were very good with attentive staff. The leisure facilities are outstanding.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"We loved this hotel. It was an excellent base for exploring Jersey - a short walk into the main shopping area of St. Helier and a free car park! The rooms were very well equipped, the Garden View restaurant provided full meals and lighter options throughout the day and the spa was fantastic. The staff are very friendly and efficient. One downside (which could be an issue for others) is that the hotel itself is situated on a steep hill and there are many steep from the road to the hotel entrance. However, the hotel does provide a free bus into St. Helier if needed.",5
"Good location, good hotel, good facilities, good service, good food, good value, good bye for now..will [very likely] be back. An easy walk into town so unless you have mobility problems don't bother taking car in with you....oh, good parking at Hotel de France too!",5
"Although the hotel is not as nice as the website suggests I would overall still recommend it. The service is good, staff are friendly and rooms are clean. The hotel is within 10-15 minutes walking distance to the centre of town. Breakfast is also very good (apart from the coffee) and the bistro style restaurant offers good value for money (we did not try the more expensive and highly rated Indian restaurant). The Spa and gym areas are outstanding and certainly the main reason for many to chose this place. We stayed in a standard room which was a little on the small side and especially the bed was too small. The room was to the back overlooking some water tanks. A noisy pump could be heard during the night which is one of the things which needs addressing. The walls between the…",3
"Our family stayed here for a long weekend and we thought the hotel overall was OK, but in parts a strange mix.  For example, the spa and pool are like something you would find in a 5 star Ritz Carlton.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  But then the decor in the spa rooms is a bit 1980s with stippled paint walls, the standard rooms and public areas of the hotel feel very old fashioned 3 star hotel.  Good location for walking into town, and the rate was fair value, so we would probably return.",3
"Great spa room with balcony.  Shuttle into town center was appreciated.  You can make the walk as well as it is not too far.  Front desk staff VERY helpful.  After checking out, we left our bags in storage and spent the day in town.  We had an evening flight but were told we could still make use of the pool even though we had already checked out.  Great customer service.  ",5
   it was spoilt by a little bit of carelessness. we had soup first and were halfway through when we realised all newcomers were being offered bread buns. were not offered one even though it was part of the soup starter. the head water finally brought them after we mentioned it although we had finished. we had the haddock next and it really was full of the cooking fat. such a shame as we really enjoyed the breakfasts. mind doing our own toast on the slowest toaster I have ever used was a bit over the top.    ,4
"Stayed here many times, great location, friendly staff, best pool and spa I have ever experienced fabulous breakfast - absolutely top drawer.  Hotel on the hill overlooking St Hellier which is a short walk",5
"Hotel was beautiful. Stunning view from room. Unfortunately bed was not all that comfy, so didn't sleep too well. Food was excellent. Swimming pool etc was relaxing. Would have had some treatments.. but felt they were rather expensive.",4
"My husband was asked to do some consultancy work in Jersey and this hotel was booked for him.  I decided, never having been to Jersey before, that I would like to go too.  I made my own arrangements contacting the hotel directly.  The reception team was most helpful, especially Anca who dealt with all my questions with charm and patience. I thought our Executive Room/Suite was well worth the extra cost.  It had plenty of space for our belongings and more importantly, space for my husband to work. The super-king size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom and shower were of a high quality. The breakfast was delicious - plenty of choice and beautifully presented.  They were happy to make poached eggs and omelettes to order.  We ate in the Garden View (?) restaurant a couple of…",5
"Lovely hotel, brilliant facilities, friendly staff, fast wifi and would highly recommend, especially using the spa pools.left hotel feeling relaxed and refreshed after a good nights sleep on luxury bedding ",5
"The price we paid was unbelievable value for a hotel of this standard. Pros: great spa, gym & pool facilities, lounge bar v relaxing, staff lovely, quiet. Remo great at the lounge bar.  Cons: room v hot & no ability to control temp, q basic interior, perhaps need fridge in room, mini bar etc & tv needs more than basic channels, quoted various charges for ice in room despite having bought drinks at bar. Gym needs aircon.   Overall, would recommend for the price we paid. Assets were the most amazing pool area, staff v friendly. It's 15-20 minutes out of town up a slight hill so not for those less able esp after dinner in the heart of st helier.",5
"The hotel staff were so welcoming and helpful. They had put us in rooms next to each other overlooking St Helier and the sea, The rooms were nicely furnished and my friend forgot her feather pillow but the hotel were able to supply one for her.  The spa was beautiful and the treatment rooms and relaxation area were calming. The pools were warm (apart from plunge pool) and there was a pool which had jets for each part of the body very soothing. We ate in the Garden View Restaurant which was ok, the staff were very busy and took a while to get our bill as we wanted to pay separately. The food was not exceptional however if we had wanted that then Saffrons fitted the bill. Breakfast was extensive and suited all tastes and prompt service. We would recommend this hotel (get it when…",5
The hotel was comftarble clean and reception staff are keen to help  Stayed for 1 night not sure I would stay again Went for a evening meal 3 couples were sat at tables after I was seated  They got a menu a bread bun and a starter and a drink before I was even asked if I would like a drink  Gentleman who sat at table next to me had same experience  If this hotel wishes to have businessmen to visit they need to give the same service that they give family's  Would I go again maybe but they need to improve  maybe the waiters need to watch who comes in to restaurant 1st  They sit you at table and forget  about you,3
Delightful hotel with extremely helpful reception staff. Stunning swimming pool and spa area. A must try on anyones list. Garden View restaurant with lovely food-but service could be improved. The Saffron Restaurant is a superb experience with delicate flavours subtly enhancing local produce and excellent serving staff. Our  room in the new wing was stunning with views across St Helier skyline to Elizabeth Castle. The hotel is well situated for a stroll into the town centre. This really is the perfect setting for a short break,4
"We were very impressed when we arrived at the hotel and seen its grandeur, porter was very friendly and gave excellent service from taking our bags to putting them in our room. Reception staff was very friendly and helpful giving use all the information we needed for our stay. Room with balcony was excellent bathroom was lovely and everything was very clean, house keeping was first class with clean towels every day. Could not falt breakfasts or restaurant food which was of the highest quality. A shuttle bus was available 5 times a date to take/collect you from St Helier which was free of charge. We throughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone who likes a touch of class, we would stay again without any problem, pity we were one there for 7 days.",5
"Just back from a couple of days at the above hotel in St. Hellier, Jersey.  It was my first time vsiiting the channel Islands with the family and thoroughly enjoyed the experince.  Hotel was very well run, service and food was excellent. 1st class breakfast set us up for the day and leisure spa was stunning.",5
"Arrived at the Hotel de France for a 5 day business trip. Quick check in but allocated a room with a connecting door (which I hate), but reception changed it very quickly. Room size was ok with a good sized wardrobe and a desk with a chair. Powerful shower too. Breakfast was excellent with a great choice of hot and cold buffet. As I was back the following week, I asked for a note to be made for the ""no connecting door"" and on check in for the 2nd week... they knew this... which I was impressed with. Good restaurant (Garden View Restaurant) with a good choice of simple but tasty food. Not the best service in the world...but it was fine. Good value for money though.",4
Went for two nights with a friend - very relaxed stay in the hotel de France   Twin room on 5th floor was clean and comfortable - was a bit too warm and you couldn't open the window nor adjust the temperature but it wasn't too bad   Breakfast was good quality and plentiful although the breakfast room was a bit tired   The hotel is huge and parts of it doesn't seem used - it could be considered soulless but for what we needed it was perfect   Staff were really excellent and customer service good. Reception printed out some boarding passes for us and also as we were going to the 'Durrell dash' run early on the Sunday they did a take out lunch for us   Used the hotel bar one evening for cocktails which was lovely - cocktail menu is extensive and delicious   Spa facilities lovely…,4
"Room was superb,breakfast had a great choice and lovely food. The Spa was spotless and well equipped would certainly recommend this hotel, the staff were so helpful and it was for us a relaxing weekend and we will be back.",5
"The hotel is situated within walking distance of the centre of St Helier, overlooking the town. The rooms are comfortable, very clean, and in good condition.  The Garden Restaurant serves some good food and the staff are very pleasant",4
"This was my second visit to hotel de France on business. The hotel is very comfortable, clean and the staff are friendly.   The food available during lunch and evenings is very nice, portions are a little irregular, for example the chilli was half the size of the fish dish but all affordable and tasty. The staff were more than happy to accommodate for my wheat allergy.  The spa is by far the best facility of the hotel! A very welcome place to spend the afternoon after a hard day at work!   With a short walk into st helier and the on site facilities I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel! ",4
"We were on a 5 day package that included the hotel, car hire & flights.  The hotel was very good, particularly the Garden Restaurant and the Spa.  We ordered room service the first morning, not great - too many minor errors, e.g. one set of cutlery for two of us, butter came later.  Food in the Garden Restaurant was lovely, we ate there most evenings.  Parking was pleasantly easy.   ",4
My wife and I stayed here for the Jersey construction awards for the weekend. We were welcomed by very friendly staff and everybody we encountered made our stay pleasurable. We made full use of the facilities and the Spa is absolute heaven. I would recommend a spa room or suite as the light and space is second to none. We will definitely stay here again and can't wait,5
"I recently booked this Hotel for a Hen weekend, for my best friend and 13 others. The standard of service we received was exemplary, in particular offered by Fay on the reception desk who regularly went above and beyond the call of expectation  to look after us and all our needs.  The Spa facilities are some of the best I have ever seen and Sabrina did an amazing job in taking care of treatments for us.  I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone looking for a personal and specialised service, combined with excellent customer care.",5
"Spent Friday to Sunday at this hotel in a single room on a B&B basis. Breakfast was excellent! Very comfortable bed and warm room with excellent hospitality tray, and clean towels every day. The only negative was the shortage of storage space for shirts/jumpers, but managed with some shelving.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. The Spa facility was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and would recommend Hotel de France for short breaks and longer holidays.",5
"A lovely hotel with fabulous facilities and very friendly staff. Situated quite close to town centre, about 15 minutes walk away,  lovely breakfast and rooms lovely and clean with lots of character, well worth a visit, the spa is to die for xxx",5
"Hotel France is a very elegant hotel. The rooms are lovely and we had a wonderful view of St Helier from our bedroom window. The breakfast is really good value £5 per morning for a breakfast buffet and there was everything there you could think of. The Garden restaurant was also good value and the food was excellent my only complaint being the portions were too large for myself but my husband managed them fine.  Half portions would be a good idea.  The Spa was fabulous although I did think the treatments were too expensive for me. The staff are brilliant, nothing was too much trouble and a special mention for the reception staff you are amazing. The only downside for me was the walk up the hill to the hotel it is quite steep and not suitable for anyone with walking difficulties.…",4
"Booked for an adversary long weekend was a bit unsure on the location but only 15 mins walk to town through a park was ok. The staff were excellent and always helpful, room large and clean, spa was a bonus well worth a visit, breakfast was the best. In all a great stay.",5
Beautiful hotel with great breakfast. Never been to a more friendly place than Jersey. Tennerfest was a bonus. The rain didn't stop us having a great time. War tunnels worth the trip. Will definitely be returning to the island ,5
"Great hotel, located near the centre of St Helier in Jersey. My wife spent a week there and I joined her for a long weekend, we were sad to leave. The room was luxurious and well appointed, with a very comfortable bed, with a roomy well appointed bathroom. The walk in shower/ wet room section was a real treat. Breakfast was of good quality, available form 7 am to 10 am daily, we only ate in the Orangery bistro which had a good varied menu and meals were well presented and prepared. The fish was fantastic, only one dish was sent back by my wife earlier in the week, the staff had a real dressing down and it never slipped again. The hotel has great facilities and we will be back next year.",5
"Wanted to surprise my husband who was celebrating becoming an OAP!  Hotel recommended by friends and we were certainly not disappointed.  When we arrived we discovered we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite with a sea view which was lovely, spacious and so comfortable. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.  10-15 min walk into town.  Breakfast in the Orangery was tasty, plentiful and a selection sufficient to suit all tastes.  Certainly pick this hotel again on our next visit to Jersey.  ",5
"We had an overnight stay in this lovely hotel, the spa is just lovely, light and relaxing, the spa room was large and well equipped, large windows and a balcony. We had a lovely meal in the Garden view restaurant and the breakfast was perfect. Staff excellent. We would highly recommend this hotel .",5
"We held three conferences at the HdF Sept-Oct and couldn't fault the staff or facilities. From the initial enquiry all the way through staff were attentive to our every need. The room was perfect for the conferences, and the private meals in the evening.",5
"We stayed in a spa room which was great, so spacious.  Being in the same area as the spa meant we could take the lift in our white fluffy robes, which was perfect.  The newer part of the hotel by the spa and gym has its own lift and staircase so it feels quite separate from the main part.  Breakfast was delicious, everything you could possibly want, quite full when we went but it never felt overcrowded.  Staff friendly and polite.  15 min walk into town  ",5
"A lovely weekend away! The hotel is huge but feels intimate! The room was a standard room but was a very good size! Breakfast was great with a large selection to choose from to suit everyone. We ate in the Garden View restaurant and the food was good and reasonably priced! The Spa really is the piece de resistance of the hotel and has been voted #1 on the island. The pool was lovely and warm and a very decent size, lots of choice in the gym. We didn't have any treatments but enjoyed what we did make the most of! We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel!!!",4
"Took advantage of JT Rewards deal with an over night stay for wife's  birthday. Just the job.. warm welcome from helpful staff.Room  very comfortable and positioned away from the lift as requested. Hotel presented very well, spar and pool excellent. Dinner at Saffrons highly recommended. Managed to squeeze in an excellect cook breakfast the nect morning . ",4
"We have returned to Hotel de France for several years now as we find standard, service and staff consistently good and meets our every need. The hotel is light, airy and clean. We visited when my husband was in a wheelchair because of an accident and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had and greatly needed wonderful break. The Spa is like spending as few hours in heaven, would thoroughly recommend it. ",5
"This holiday was to celebrate my 80th birthday and 60 years of marriage. we were given a lovely room and were welcomed with a bottle of Proseco, fruit and flowers. The hotel service was excellent from the moment we stepped through the doors until the moment we left. The staff were so friendly and attentive. They really seemed to enjoy their jobs. We couldn't fault the breakfasts in the orangery. The food in the main restaurant was very good so much so that we never the need to eat at any other restaurants with the exception of a meal at the Saffron Restaurant. That was an experience in eating. Subtle spices - delicious food. A night to remember. The spa at the hotel and the treatment centre were excellent. We enjoyed a hot stone massage. It was so relaxing. All in all we had a…",5
"This is the tenth time we have stayed at the hotel de France. We have tried other hotels in St helier but the de France is our favourite by a mile. The staff are charming and very helpful, the breakfast is excellent and the spa facility is perfect. The only downside is the walk into the town, but we made use of the courtesy bus when we didn't want to drive ",5
"Was transferred to Hotel de France when our first choice hotel was overbooked and we were contacted only the tuesday before leaving on the thursday. But the change was fabulously fortuitous as this hotel exceeded our hopes and wishes. Great staff, food,facilities. Alround 5 star accomadation.",5
I stayed in one of the standard rooms in the older section of the hotel which was more than adequate however I did get to see one of the spa rooms which I would definitely book next time.  The facilities are plentiful the swimming pools were were some of the best I have used in hotels! ,5
"All of the staff are polite, considerate, happy, welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. Hotel is spotlessly clean throughout, very comfortable, well furnished, air conditioning and central heating add to the comfort. All food outlets offer superb cuisine and dining can be as relaxed or informal as you want it to be. The breakfast choices are fantastic. Spa facilities are wonderful - pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, gym - emphasis on healthy lifestyles is reflected in the cuisine without being overbearing. Located above St Helier the views are lovely and a complimentary shuttle bus is provided for ease of access to the town centre. We would certainly return for another holiday! Highly recommended.",5
"Arrived at hotel at 930am and room was ready,pool and spa were great plenty of loungers to chilli on. Breakfast was excellent,only negative was lack of plug socket in room so had to use kettle on floor Courtesy bus into town 4/5 times a day . Staff very helpful  Would definitely recommend        ",5
"Having stayed away on business with other hotels in Jersey - The Hotel de France exceeds all others. Great Service, Clean rooms. When time allows, I look forward to getting the chance to use the Spa & Gym facilities.        ",4
"We booked a 3 night stay at this hotel through Secret Escapes and we have had the most fabulous time.  The hotel is quite old fashioned, not tired but traditional.  The staff from reception to bar staff to housekeeping - everyone is so friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is buffet style and has loads to choose from ( the room can feel a little chilly - it is October ) so wear a pullover! The bistro restaurant serves the most fantastic food and are so efficient! Everything that came from that kitchen looked and tasted amazing and was really well presented.  The Saffron restaurant was also a fantastic place to eat - its not cheap but its amazing, we have never had indian food like it - really fabulous.  The rooms are all a good size and like I said earlier are very traditional,…",5
"We spent a very enjoyable week at the Hotel de France.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff were very helpful.  We had a lovely room looking over the gardens.  The best part was the spa which had excellent facilities.  We managed to swim most mornings before breakfast. The only snag was that the Hotel is quite a walk up from the town, which is fine in good weather.  The Hotel ran a shuttle bus each morning which we usually got into the bus station and it did have a return journey around 5 pm which we occasionally got back up.  There was no shuttle in the evening so we usually walked both ways except for the very wet evening when we took a taxi which was not unreasonable.  There was the option of dining in the Hotel which had quite a good menu but we usually like to go out…",4
"Having stayed here a number of time this hotel is a luxury hotel in a ideal location, The hotel has high class amenities including swimming pool and gym. The hotel has wi-fi throughout and a restaurant serving asian cuisine. The staff are friendly and welcoming and nothing is too much to ask. The rooms are spacious with great views of the town form its hilltop location.",5
"Lovely hotel, very well trained, welcoming, helpful staff. Vast choice at breakfast, the 2 restaurants give one the choice to ""push the boat out"" at Saffrons or spend less in the other one. Not close to town so be prepared to walk or taxi. ",5
"Our spacious quiet room was in the older part of the Hotel and was furnished in 'Country House' style, but with a very modern and well equipped en-suite Bathroom attached. An excellent combination. Breakfast was taken in 'The Orangery' which was a very full 'English' and in the evening we ate in the Garden View Restaurant which served good food at sensible prices. All of the Staff that we encountered were very polite and helpful and during our four day visit we thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance of a Traditional Hotel but run in a Modern manner. We will return again to this Hotel.",5
"We stayed here for the weekend as a celebration of our 25th wedding anniversary. We spent our honeymoon on Jersey and haven't been back since. The check in staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, giving us lots of information about the facilities of this beautiful hotel. When we got to our room we were delighted to find a bottle of Prosecco on ice and a lovely fruit bowl, a really lovely touch to kick off our celebrations. Our room was spotlessly clean and spacious with everything we needed. We didn't eat in the hotel but spent some time in the bar, the bar waiters were also very friendly and attentive and made great cocktails. This hotel is only a 10 minute stroll into main St Hellier, away from the hustle and very quiet. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and…",5
"We first stayed at Hotel de France in September 1985; our first of several trips to Jersey. Returning to the hotel after 30 years was quite a pleasant surprise.  The main entrance has been relocated, and the original, with its sweeping steps now leads to a large terrace overlooking the beautiful gardens. This area is ideal for drinks, lunches and dinners or just to sit with a glass of 'holiday therapy' sunbathing or reading. The new entrance leads into a large foyer furnished with plenty of seating, and plenty of room to walk unhindered to the reception desk.  The many lifts/ elevators visit all floors and are very efficient, and all hotel staff know the geography of the hotel and can assist if one is lost in this beautifully appointed hotel.  My wife and I were delighted with…",5
"Stayed here for two nights with my daughter,we had two rooms on the third floor which were clean and comfy .  I had room 308 which was facing the lifts .(very handy)   I must say I had a relaxing sleep on both nights. The staff throughout my stay were both friendly and very knowledgeable and must be praised.  The check in was quick and professional.      We used the spa once and were very impressed by it.(towels and lockers are provided )     Over the years I have stayed in various hotels around the world, the breakfast I had was the best ever on choice and taste and surroundings,once again the staff at breakfast were first class .        I do not visit Jersey a lot but would definitely stay at the Hotel de France again",5
"I recently spent 8 nights at the Hotel de France. I could not fault my stay in any way. In recent years the hotel has spent an extremely large amount of money on the Gym/Training facility. This combined with the pool, spa and Ayush Wellness facility, makes it the finest leisure/fitness facility I have seen, in over 40 years of extensive travel, around the world. I had a really nice room, at the front of the hotel, with a view, looking down over St Helier. The bed was very comfortable and the room cleaned to a high standard, every day. The selection at breakfast was excellent and meals in the Garden view restaurant were very high quality and reasonably priced. Staff in the hotel are first class and a real credit to the management of the hotel.",5
"Had a great stay at Hotel de France. Holiday was booked to celebrate 25th Anniversary. Hotel provided complementary wine, fruit, flowers. Taster menu in Saffrons was some of the best food I've tasted.       ",5
Beautiful hotel with excellent leisure facilities.  Dining facilities are superb.  Breakfast selection was excellent with a very good selection of hot and cold foods.  The staff go above and beyond the call of duty.  Hotel front is on a steep incline and would be difficult if you are not good at walking.                            ,5
"Clean and tidy rooms all the facility's you require,very friendly and helpful staff breakfast was excerlant shuttle to town was realisable the spa was out of this world spend as much time as you like the massage was excerlant and very good value for money              ",5
"on suite bathroom a bit dated ie old fashioned bath with shower over and worst of all a shower curtain. the staff were excellent, friendly and efficient and the pool facilities were outstanding.did not appreciate the steep climb up from the road.                                   ",4
"we use to go to Jersey, for rest, sport, spa, and..;of course shopping! We often stay in hotel de France, just perfect. No stress, no noice, really clean, wonderfull restaurant, we had à dinner in the Saffrons restaurant, Indian tast and flavour, with local food just.....you must try it. We'll come back as soon as possible. many thanks to this real professionnal  team .       ",5
Very helpful friendly staff! Nice but reasonale restaurant. Lovely spa too! Lovely breakfast. We had to stay extra nights because of ferry cancellations staffdid their best to accommodate us. We enjoyed the extra nights :) Would recommend.        ,5
"We had a spa room which comes with an amazing bathroom, views over the town, big size bed. Staff is as always very friendly and helpful. We had dinner at Aroma's which was very good. Parking there is also easy as it is on site. We go quite often for a break and we love it.       ",5
"Genuine 4*.The staff were particularly attentive and helpful. The pool, and rest of the wet area, was 5*. The massages and such were pricey.   All meals were good but Saffrons was exquisite: perfect service, presentation, pace, price and taste. Best meal my wife and I have enjoyed. It was our 45 anniversary and we wanted something special, and certainly got it.   It is a fair walk into the town centre through unprepossessing streets and the shuttle is infrequent. Taxis are cheap enough. Also the climb from the road could test even the most athletic after a night in town. Go for a round island trip early on in your holiday. It is cheap enough and will give you destinations. Excellent coverage by bus and the locals are very willing to chat and give hints of where to go.   You…",4
"We had a couples overnight spa package (which also included an evening meal).  The massage was lovely and there was even a 'relaxation room' afterwards.  The spa facilities were great with a regular pool, 'plunge pool', hydrotherapy pool and a cold pool.  The evening meal was tasty with a reasonably good choice on the menu.  The room was very comfortable (and we were upgraded for free :-) ) and reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Overall a nice size hotel - probably about 100 or so rooms, so you don't feel too anonymous nor did the hotel feel 'stuffy' at all.",5
Fantastic hotel with great staff who went out of their way to help and make the stay most enjoyable. Breakfast was very good with a Hughes selection of hot and cold food. Location of hotel just right as just out of centre but took us only ten minutes to walk to town. Good car parking facilities also. Spa and garden great                                   ,5
"This is a comfortable hotel with very good spa, pool and gym facilities. It´s about a mile away from the center of town.   I had problems booking taxis from the hotel. the taxis either didn´t show up, or arrived late. ",4
"Myself and my wife had a short 5 day break in Jersey and stayed in this hotel. The hotel clean, well serviced and the staff very polite and helpful. The hotel is in a good location that is not too far from the town centre, but just far enough away. No parking issues. Overall very satisfied with our visit.       ",5
"Had Spa room for the walk in shower facility but had to sacrifice twin beds for it. As my husband has Parkinson's disease, the nights were not good and it would put me off going there again.  Found the hotel to be a bit soulless, bar on 1st floor.  It should really be in the vast reception area as that was extremely quiet, not even any piped music.  Didn't eat in the main restaurant Saffrons as not keen on Indian food and was expensive.  Ate most nights in the Garden Room which was quite good and reasonably priced.  Their is a shuttle bus into town which only left 5 times a day, the last one being 5pm so no night shuttle.  Found the staff (especially in the Garden Room) very helpful.  Nice hotel but needs a bit of cheering up.",4
"This is the third occasion that we have stayed at the Hotel de France and it does not disappoint, we received a warm welcome on our arrival and the facilities available were outlined. We were offed porterage to our room which we didn't need the lifts were close by and gave easy access to our room. We had planned to use the spa which is amazing but for various reasons we did not get around to, we had four excellent Breakfasts, and ate in both restaurants during our stay. Overall the hotel and staff met our expectations we were dealt with in a friendly an efficient manner throughout. An enjoyable and memorable stay. ",5
"I stay at the Hotel de France almost every week. The hotel is excellent, well maintained, well organised with extremely professional friendly staff. The food is of top quality and well presented.  The rooms are always clean and tidy and lack in nothing. Parking is available and it is only a short walk into St Helier. I have stayed in other hotels locally, but none of them compare to the Hotel de France. ",5
"Everything about this hotel was excellent and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were treated with the utmost courtesy at all times. Although it is not particularly near the beach or restaurants, there is a courtesy bus that takes you to St Helier town centre, although you can walk as it's not very onerous if you are reasonably fit (it's slightly uphill on the way back). For evening meals, we only tried the hotel's Garden View restaurant and the standard of service and food was first class. The only slight comment is that the chairs in that restaurant were rather uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. However, overall it was excellent. We would definitely go there again.",5
"This hotel is really good the saff have been fantastic.  We are staying here at the hotel de France on Jersey this week, today 22nd September my daughter and I visited the spa facilities at the hotel. I must say I was impressed.!!  The AYUSH spa treatments looked good so I decided to treat myself to some treatments, I opted for a full Indian massage and a foot massage. I can with hand on heart say that these were very good I would not hesitate in recommending these treatments, the therapist Priya who carried out my treatments was very good, I left feeling very relaxed and happy with my treatments I had chosen.. Thanks very much to the staff at the AYUSH SPA.  The hotel staff from first arriving have been tremendous, from our greeting to the restaurant staff, the food well…",5
"This is a great looking hotel with good facilities. The stand-out of this hotel is the staff who are all very polite and attentive. The spa facilities are above average with an interesting layout and plenty of loungers. The only part lacking and I am only stating this in the interest balance is that breakfast could provide a little better selection and facility, but you will still be quite happy with it, I am sure.",4
"Stayed for a few days on a birthday trip.  Excellent hotel, staff very friendly and Saffron restaurant was amazing.  Spa and pool excellent.  Would have liked a larger bar for an evening drink.  15 minutes walk to town centre but good value for money.",5
"The staff were fantastically helpful, friendly and professional..nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant staff in particular were wonderful. Comfortable rooms, fabulous breakfast...nothing negative at all. Would totally recommend.",5
"The hotel was excellent,breakfast included and free high speed wi-fi.Even though the Orange juice was not not freshly squeezed I could not fault the breakfast.We had evening meals in the restaurant and again they were excellent.",5
"I thoroughly enjoyed my business stay in his hotel. The spa was fantastic. The hotels restaurants were great, wide choice, great service and good food.  A bit further out than most but it's only a 10-15 minute walk to centre. Would recommend , especially as I have been to other hotels nearby and this one is far better for similar price.",3
"My wife & I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. I booked Hotel De France through Booking.com for our long weekend. We thought that we had a good deal considering the quality of the hotel & what is on offer there.  The room was large which made it look a little sparse, but was spotlessly clean & had all we needed. We had a balcony room in the newer part of the hotel with great views over St Helier town.  The reception, bars & restaurant staff were extremely friendly & very helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the Garden view restaurant a couple of times. The food was excellent & were pleasantly surprised by the great value for money.  The hotel spa was a revelation. The pools, sauna & steam room with their ambient lighting certainly make for a relaxing…",5
"Not the newest of buildings but pure class, of decor, cleanliness, features, and very helpful pleasant staff at every location through out the complex .  Room (269) was spotless, very quiet and ideal for a single occupancy, shower super, TV easy.... breakfast was 5* everything hot , and of a high standard, I liked the fact that the tables were well spaced and it was light and airy. Food in the hotel was fantastic, but the spa and pools were amazing, easily the best I have used and designed by someone who knows what people want on holiday !! spent many hours here swimming and sat in the immaculate sauna's ...a must if you stay in Jersey , Taxi takes you to the door , lifts to all floors ...a true delight",5
"My friend from the USA and I booked a Secret Escape (5 Days) we arrived to an efficient welcome and friendly staff. The porter quickly attended to our luggage, and an extra bed was installed into  a Spa bedroom, as my friend needed a walk in shower. There was £25 a night supplement for this, I felt a little expensive but however we needed the shower, and rooms only had a double bed, so it was a solution. The hotel is in a difficult to find location, due to the one way system, once there (after two hours driving around) we managed to locate the hotel pretty well. I also found it difficult to get driving directions from the hotel website, maybe something to be looked into. We found all staff very helpful especially Cristi a very helpful and pleasant waiter, both on the terrace and…",4
"We regularly visit Jersey (2 or 3 times a year) and have recently returned from another wonderful holiday there, for the second time we stayed at the wonderful Hotel De France and have decided that it is definitely our favourite hotel on the island.  From the moment you arrive you are welcomed liked old friends, the reception staff greet you with a smile, they offer to get the concierge to park your car, the whole check in process is quick and efficient.  On our previous visit we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a wonderful Spa room so this time we made the decision to go all out and book to stay in one of these delightful rooms, no they are not the cheapest but as far as we are concerned they are worth every penny. The rooms are in their own 'wing' of the hotel, they are…",5
"We chose the Hotel de France on recommendation of the woman in our local Thompson. It was as she said: pleasant facilities, near to the town centre but far enough away. The room was a little small but was OK. The spa was very good, if a little pricey for massages, etc, and the swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna etc were about as good as it gets for 4-star. The staff were very attentive and our room was immaculately kept, so what one would expect from the literature and star rating. However: we had dinner at the Saffron restaurant. It was vaguely Indian cuisine, which we both quite like, but are not major fans of. But this was different. Whilst the room was nothing special, everything else, from service, presentation of the food, taste, price, pace, atmosphere, and more, made the…",4
"As most travellers do before they head off to the unknown, I checked trip advisor a day or so before we flew out. I must admit, after reading a few bad reviews, I was disheartened and thought I had been sold a dud trip by Secret Escapes.  But it goes to show that what other people experience is not what you will.  We had a very pleasant stay at Hotel de France and it was not as bad as some people say. I agree that it does need a good upgrade with the rooms and the lighting in the bathroom needs to be brighter, pillows plumper and hair conditioner would be nice. More plug sockets would also be a good idea. But besides that the room was comfortable and so was the bed. The spa was nice and a great place to relax and unwind.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Especially the…",4
"If you want a great hotel on Jersey, then you will not go wrong in choosing the Hotel de France. The service is some of the best I have ever come across, with nothing being too much trouble for the very friendly staff. The Food in all of the restaurants is of the highest standard with the menu in the Saffron being a real culinary experience. The breakfast offering (buffet) caters for all requirements with any specific needs also catered for. The Hotel is only a 20 minute walk from the town centre (st Helier) where you can at the bus station get a ride or a tour to any part of the island most journeys are only £2.  If you do not want to walk the Hotel runs a shuttle bus down to the town  several times a day with pick ups. The Hotel has some other fantastic facilities including…",5
"We have just returned from an excellent 5 day break at the Hotel De France. The hotel was beautiful and the spa, the stuff of legends. It has been voted one of the best spas in Europe and rightly so. The amenities at the hotel were beautiful and the terrace bar is very attractive. We had intended to eat out, being B&B only, but the hotel restaurants were so good we never did. Breakfasts are a marvel with every choice under the sun, and the chef will cook other foods to order. The Jersey Bio yoghurt is a must. We had only booked a twin room which was more than adequate for our needs, but should you want more I would recommend upgrading as the room was quite small. Toiletries and towels along with towelling dressing gowns were 5*.  Parking was good and easy to achieve, and I say…",5
"We stayed for a week and did not want to leave....every aspect of the hotel was excellent.  All staff (housekeeping, front of house, food and beverage) were exceptional - friendly, warm, welcoming and helpful.  Our room was spacious, clean and a stunning view over St Helier with loads of fluffy towels, bathrobes and a daily top up of toiletries and biscuits.  Dinner in Garden View was excellent - a small menu with daily specials - well cooked, beautifully served and tasted great.  The daily breakfast buffet was a highlight with everything imaginable.  Dinner at Saffrons was a unique experience.  Ample parking and around 15 minutes to walk into the centre of St Helier.  The hotel is a not a modern sleek affair - it is well furnished, more traditional and has an elegant…",5
"Quite mixed reviews reading other comments but can honestly say that both my wife and I had a very pleasant stay here in a standard room.  Only waited a few minutes for the room to be ready and were impressed.   Free wifi worked well, parked easily during our stay and receptionist wished us a happy anniversary upon checkout so noted comments made when booking!  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was nice, a wide variety.    Unfortunately the hotel is behind a 1960's looking office block on Saint Saviours Road so this does effect the wow factor when arriving and quite a few steps if walking from the road level so this could prove difficult for the disabled but on the whole, would recommend and stay here again.",5
"Spent three nights here and really enjoyed our stay. All the staff were friendly, cheerful and helpful.  Our room (125) was spacious, spotlessly clean and contained everything we needed.  There was no view but as we were only there to sleep this did not matter.  Breakfast was really good, vast choice of food and drink and the staff in the restaurant were welcoming and efficient. Had a lovely evening meal in the garden view restaurant and found the bar to be very pleasant. Spa facilities are excellent. Would definitely return.",5
"This former Grand Hotel is now moderately priced but still has all the conveniences a traveller needs. Good restaurants in the hotel so you don't have to eat out after a busy day sightseeing. The highlight is the Spa facility which is accessible directly from the hotel. Hotel guests have use of the pool, sauna,and beautiful relaxing gardens. Covered parking is also a plus. Shuttle bus is also available to reach city centre which is only 10 minutes away on foot.",4
Excellent place to stay for a mini break. Service was excellent. Rooms a little tired but overall very good. Indian restaurant in hotel awesome! I would recommend hiring bikes and tour round the island... great relaxing place to spend a few days.,4
"I stayed at the hotel with 3 friends for the weekend and all of us left with the intention of booking a return trip ASAP.  The reception staff on arrival were exceptionally helpful and welcoming, our rooms had the most fantastic view across St Helier, the Ayush spa is definitely the best spa we've been to in Jersey - Sabrina the Spa Manager was also very helpful and we enjoyed a few cheeky cocktails in the well stocked bar each evening.

"We are a group of 4 ladies who travelled from Guernsey for the Jersey Live Festival.  The Hotel de France was the perfect location with fantastic service, great rooms, lovely Spa area and super breakfast ! Nothing was too much trouble and I am already looking forward to my next stay !",5
"We stayed in the spa room before just me and my husband for a 3 night break 5 years ago and it was lovely. Fast forward to this year, stay here again, bring the two kids, what could go wrong? Well most things it seems.   Most of the staff are fantastic, polite, happy, funny and keen to offer suggestions or go the extra mile but when you get the odd ones who hold managerial positions, who aren't  it all falls apart.  We were half board - what a mistake. The breakfasts are good, buffet style with a great range of food. The evening meals are either Garden View which is ok, nothing special or expensive A la Carte.  It took 2hrs most nights to get three courses done and they're pub grub style choices. It's no gastronomic emporium. If you went early you still waited?? With a 12yr old…",1
"A short stay, with family. Double room with great view, single room at back ,so no view. but room perfect. Lovely Restaurants, food better than average. The staff where very helpful and prompt. Plenty of rest areas, Superb Swimming pool and spa. A grown up Hotel. The town was within walking distance.",5
"I cannot understand how so many people rate this hotel.  I have stayed in better B&B's than this hotel.  The room was so small that they could barely squeeze in two single beds, push them together and try to fool us into believing they were a double.  The mattresses were completely useless and way beyond their best and frankly only fit for the rubbish tip.  The bed bases were filthy and again not what you would expect of a four star hotel. The price the hotel charges for rooms is not reflected in the quality of the furniture and fittings.  The management need to wake up an stop ripping people off with sub standard services.   I was so appalled at the state of the room that I asked to be moved.  The reception staff were unhelpful and took a haughty attitude towards us.  That was…",1
My wife and I stayed for 6 nights in a junior suite which was well appointed except for a lack of a chest of draws. The staff were friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant every evening as the food was excellent and reasonably priced. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again. ,4
"The use of the Spa was a real plus point, it's modern, clean and well maintained. The room was old, however very clean and tidy with good views over Jersey out towards St Aubin Bay. Very quiet and slept very well. The reception staff were very helpful, letting us check in early, looked after our bags, printed our boarding pass for return flights - couldn't fault them. The breakfast was good, varied selection and enjoyable. The outside seating area could have been improved with nicer table and chairs and if cigarette butts had been swept away. Staff very relectent to take drink orders and had to keep approaching them rather than them coming to us. The grass area with sun loungers looked very well maintained. We ate one evening at the garden bar/restaurant. The food was not good…",3
"very pleasant stay but def not 5*, mainly due to the restaurant, very boring menu and not that well cooked. Staff were helpful, although wait for comp bus into town took ages and then was too full so ended up odering a taxi, much better! had to insist that we park in the garage by the hotel, there was a vintage car rally on and they told my husband that they had first call, he told them that was unacceptable and they freed up a space.",4
"great hotel depending on room size, if lucky enough to get a good room this hotel has it all for a relaxing getaway break, if however you get one of the smaller rooms you will feel cramped and hot in a room built for 1, the facilities, staff and choice of food make it a great hotel to visit,",4
The good.....We stayed here for 4 nights over the bank holiday and I loved the hotel.  The restaurants are not old fashioned as one reviewer thought.  Saffrons does the most lovely Indian food - and a tasting menu which may be expensive for some at £50 including wines throughout but it really was a delightful experience.  The Garden View Restaurant does more 'down to earth' food but the quality is really brilliant.  The staff throughout the hotel were extremely pleasant and all deserve a big pat on the back.  Nothing was too much trouble and I don't think we were met with anything less than a beaming smile from any of them (in fact I think the staff really make this hotel what it is).  Didn't use the spa area but it had been made clear to us that we were welcome to do so if we…,4
"My husband and I visited this hotel for a special occasion, and were somewhat underwhelmed with the whole experience. No one went 'the extra mile' and the hotel didn't give any 'special experience' whatsoever. You'd expect the same from a Premier Inn.  The hotel itself is grand and looks like a beautiful building. The professional photographs are well-done, as it's actually right behind a very ugly medical centre, so the drive up to the front wasn't that impressive!  Check in was quick and formal, not really any personality, and not much to report on.  The room itself was big, however boasts a very 90's style decor and is in need of updating, we wouldn't really have minded, but given the price of the room, and the fact we'd paid more to upgrade our room, we were a little…",3
"This hotel really needs an update  Stinks of cigarettes  Food very basic  Shame as staff are lovely  The swimming pool area is great  Could be amazing  The spa is nice had a nice treatment but not  amazed by it .  I feel bit too expensive for what you get , which is a shame   ",2
"Myself and my partner came here for the bank holiday weekend which was booked through Secret Escapes. Please do not be fooled by the hotels pictures. When we arrived we where put into a room that overlooked the back of the hotel, the lift also backed into our room so the noise was terrible. We requested another room including offering to pay for an upgrade if necessary. We where moved to another room for one night and told we would need to be moved again the following night(A little annoying but it was accepted due to the fact that our initial room was so poor). Second room was slightly better and we where told our third room would be an upgrade. Being so disappointed in the experience of the hotel we decided to spend the day away from the hotel on the Saturday returning at…",1
"I booked this hotel for our anniversary.  All I can say is they put us in the worst room I have ever stayed in.  Very small, two single beds with very bad mattresses that were filthy dirty.  Do not go by the reviews we walked out and booked another hotel.  Take my advice don't go here you will be disappointed.",1
"I love the Hotel de France; it just has an old world charm about it as well as being up to date and modern.  We stayed there last June and have just returned from a four night break.  This time we booked a spa room and were not disappointed.j The spa rooms are very large with minimalist decor in browns, beiges and creams. One wall is almost all glass and consists of two huge glass doors,one of which leads on to a small balcony with table and chairs and the other opens with a juliette balcony of what I presume is reinforced glass.  The view from the balcony is over Saint Hellier to the sea.  Last year we had a standard room with a view over the terrace and the gardens. I preferred last year's outlook but the spa room is a much better room, so it is swings and roundabouts so to…",4
"A beautiful hotel with attentive and polite members of staff.  The hotel is best suited to those who want to make full use of the hotel facilities, rather than using it as a base to explore the island.  The hotel is a 20minute walk from St Helier and there are a flight of stairs to the Hotel entrance - or you could brave the steep slope.  Hotel residents have free use of the Gym and the Spa are (Pool etc).  The Pool is well worth a visit - it is best to visit in the early morning or late evening, these are the times when children are not using the pool (but do not worry, it is not over run with kids). The only downside are the paper thin walls in the bedrooms...I am a deep sleeper but I could hear snoring and conversations in the next room.  Be prepared!!!",4
"We had a single & double room next door to each other as requested. These were located at the top of the building in what seemed to be a poorer quality area. Whilst everything was very clean & tidy the rooms were rather ""worn"". The double bed was very hard and uncomfortable, however the rest of the room was fine. We only had breakfast which whilst being very nice was expensive compared to other hotels. We chose the France because we had stayed here before and found it very comfortable however that time we had a family room in a different part of the hotel. As a foot note due to Easyjet cancelling our flight home we had to stay in Jersey for an extra night which we spent in the Greenhills hotel. This like the France is 4 star rated however Greenhills is far superior, not sure how…",4
We booked this hotel because we thought although it was a bit of a hike to the town (a good 20 minute walk) there was plenty of outdoor space. This is no longer true - apparently some 15 or more years ago they built on what was the front lawn and they built a huge monstrous clinic thing which frankly is an eyesore. The patio is however really nice and there is a tiny piece of garden with loungers etc.   The spa is gorgeous - the pools are warm (very warm!!) and there is plenty of loungers to hang out on. The changing rooms are very well cared for and have everything you need.    We booked a balcony room and it was very spacious - could really do with some interior design as could the rest of the hotel - the wallpaper they have in the corridors is the same that we had in our…,4
"An excellent hotel worthy of 5 stars.    The staff were friendly and went out of their way to make sure our stay was enjoyable.  The spa is one of the finest I have been.  It is very large, very clean with sumptuous dressing gowns and limitless white fluffy towels.  The bedroom had a garden view (beautifully kept) with a distant view of St Hellier harbour.  The room was well decorated and a reasonable size.  The bathroom had a large deep bath and powerful shower with more sumptuous towels and dressing gowns.   The room had tea and coffee making facilities and biscuits.  The hotel has two restaurants both serving excellent food at reasonable prices.  There is a courtesy bus into St Hellier ( 15 minute walk).  The bus stop outside the hotel also goes into town and Durrells zoo. …",5
"Sadly the pictures OF the hotel are better than the picture one would take FROM the hotel... We asked for high floor for the view but did not realise this would mean two small dormer windows which only half  open. We had a very hot night and the secondary installed air conditioner units do not work and sound like an airport runway! However it was clean, err is not run down or evening check so if you have wet towels from the morning or after swim shower you are stuck with them! There is no mini bar in the room nor bottled water. Sadly, I think this hotel has dropped its standards from its grander past and image... Shame if it had kept the park around it and gone for quality instead of quantity it would still merit its 4 and might even be able to aspire to a 5*. Must also express…",3
"The hotel is about a ten minute walk from town set back from the road and is accessed by a number of steps so may be difficult for less mobile people. My double room was a good size and kept clean throughout my 4-night stay.  Even though the hotel was busy, it was very quiet at night enabling a good sleep. Breakfast is buffet style and there is everything you would expect all well presented and good quality. There are plenty of restaurants in town so I did not have dinner at the hotel. The spa and pool complex is top quality with a steam room and sauna but I did not use the gym so cannot comment. A very good hotel and on my return to Jersey in September I tried to book again but it's full.  Says it all really.  ",5
"Warm and friendly check in and during the stay the staff were really helpful, courteous and so welcoming... So 5 stars there for front of house the whole duration.  Garden view restaurant, it was a very warm sunny afternoon so we though a couple of piña colada's and some fresh scampi and chips.... Our order was taken outside promptly and food arrived very quick but no drinks, having waited 30mins I headed into car to chase up the order and they were sat there waiting for us, and when brought to table they were tepid, not really the ice cold cocktail we wanted! None the less we were so thirsty at this  point we  just drank them as feared if we complained to ask for replacements we may wait another 30 minutes!  The orangery for breakfast, a good experience on all three mornings,…",4
"Our room was spacious, clean and well maintained. The location was 10 minutes walk from the centre and off road which meant no traffic noise at night. The pool and spa area was an excellent area to relax in. Staff were all very helpful and our stay was very enjoyable Would definitely stay here again.",5
A constant delight of comfort location and ease of business.  Really impressed with the obviously well trained and consisetently friendly staff. The reception team were fantastic in providing me with my favourite room       ,1
"We decided to take a 3 night break in Jersey staying at the Hotel De France and were not disappointed!  We had a Spa room (which is spacious with a large bathroom and balcony) and were very impressed with all the facilities.  Did not use the Spa so cannot comment, but restaurants (especially Saffrons) were excellent.  Staff were extremely courteous and the free car parking facilities really good for a city centre hotel.  If you like your 'Full English' Breako then we can highly recommend its worth getting out of bed for.  If I could suggest just two things (1) faster WiFi and (2) perhaps a need for a less formal bar (attached to Saffrons)?  All in all, a lovely break and Hotel De France is well worth booking!",4
"With so many uncertainties abroad I decided to stay closer to home in Jersey and was not disappointed. The hotel has a large spa comprising of a swimming pool,  hydro pool,  wet and try saunas and a several lounge beds,  treatment rooms , gym and exercise classes. The changing rooms were spacious and clean with plenty of showers.  The main negatives were that despite winning various awards there was no sense of luxury and indulgence.  The treatment prices were also not attractive which was a shame as the menu sounded interesting.  I booked a standard single room which was actually quite spacious with a full size bathroom.  Room was well maintained and comfortable but with the Standard ' label came blandness.  Hotel had two restaurants one bistro style the other more Michelin…",4
"Special no cost spared last family holiday.  5 grandchildren [aged 2 yrs to 10 yrs] Secure hotel with friendly staff, good rooms, choice of restaurants, excellent spa and swimming pools. Breakfast unbeatable. Centre of town 10 mins. away and the hotel provides a limited shuttle service to the shops.",5
"Returning to Jersey for the first time in forty years to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary, we were not let down by our choice of hotel. Sparkling wine and fresh fruit was brought to our room on arrival, courtesy of the management. We had a great room with a balcony in the newer section of the hotel. There was lots of space to put clothes and other belongings during our seven night stay and the room was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was fantastic, with a huge range of things to eat on a self-service basis as well as a number of items which you could order at your table. Whilst we did not use the Saffron Restaurant, the meals at the less formal restaurant were very well cooked and presented and at very reasonable prices. The service was excellent as indeed it was…",5
"Amazing hotel with an interesting history, and a superb refurbishment with a luxurious swimming pool with all the modern amenities.  Stayed for 2 nights and although they were quite full, there was a real feeling of tranquility throughout our stay, and air-conditioning was lovely.",5
"Hotel de France is a top quality hotel situated on a hill overlooking St Helier (about 10-15 min walk to the centre, although a courtesy shuttle bus runs at times through the day). It's a large complex incorporating spa and leisure facilities but only has 126 bedrooms so its incredibly open and spacious and clean throughout. There is ample parking on site and beautiful well maintained gardens. We stayed in one of the spa rooms, large and spacious and have every facility that you could possibly require for your stay. The staff are friendly and helpful throughout the hotel and are a massive asset to the establishment. We used the Terrace View restaurant on two occasions and both meals were excellent. As a guest you get the use of the spa and fitness facilities and these are in…",5
"Wonderful place to stay in Jersey - staff friendly and helpful, nothing any trouble at all. Excellent food throughout my stay, served in a pleasant environment both inside and out depending on the weather. Staff worked hard to attend to your every request.       ",5
"Location: hotel slightly out of  town centre but just a 5min walk to centre- perfectly quite, no traffic noise & very car-accessible -great spot if you want to relax and explore the island & drive out without being stuck in St. Helier one way systems (which are tiresome at peak times) Rooms: they are okay- frankly you won't spend much time in them because the pool is so great!  Best part- the pool / spa! Wow it is so wonderfully relaxing- with large windows onto the terrace. Great steam/ sauna. And drinks on terrace in the evening is good fun. Great restaurants (two very good options) and a fab bar. Amazing service- everywhere in the hotel people are great! Loved it and would go back. (btw the reception is so 'dowdy'- no idea why!! But don't lose heart when you see the…",5
"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, good standard of decoration in rooms, food very good, and good location and facilities. Enjoyed short 3 day break with family. There is a courtesy hotel bus so you don't always need to get a taxi into St Helier.                    ",5
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel de France. It was most enjoyable. The staff were very efficient and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel has a wide range of facilities and is very relaxing.,5
"Nice location, good service and excellent food. But no AC or adequat ventilation in the rooms. Lousy quality of air, and too hot at night. We had a super stay, but AC/ventilation problem takes away a point. ",4
"Everything from the spa, service, room and food was excellent!. The front view bedrooms are preferable to the rear with a view over St Helier. The staff are very friendly and efficient but some need more practice on their English.              ",5
"My daughter & I have just returned from a 5 night stay at The Hotel de France. From start to finish our visit was a pleasing experience. The staff were all wonderfully polite and attentive.  We had a very nice twin room on floor 2 of the hotel, which gave us excellent views across St Helier. The room had everything we could need, apart from an iron which would have been helpful. Clean and extremely comfortable. The Room fairy visited daily, replenishing sumptuous large bath towels and tea tray Breakfast in the Orangery each day was lovely. Lots of choice and attentive waiting staff/chef. Service times were great for us as we could have a lie in too ! We ate at the Garden Terrace restaurant twice , which was very good quality food and reasonably priced. We felt the Saffron menu…",5
We planned a 'long weekend' - just to get away.  Hotel and staff were fabulous as was the food. No complaints about our room and facilities.  The Hotel is a little bit off the main hub and the walk into the Hotel is quite steep.  Only complaint we had was that we were not there long enough. ,5
Stayed at the Hotel de France a number of times over the past 5 years and previously some 15+ years ago. The fact we keep returning is testament to the consistent quality of accommodation and service.   Standard rooms are nice and location is good for town (shopping) yet on the outskirts if you have a car and want to get out of St Helier without too much traffic.  This stay we took a junior suite and will certainly do this again - lovely room with picture window views over St Helier.    Breakfast is a buffet affair but with a good selection and always seems fresh.  Prices reflect the quality - not cheap but fair.    Very good and recommended.  Will definitely stay again.  ,4
"My wife and I stayed here for a weeks break, 1st - 8th August 2015. A very nice hotel, clean and smart. The facilities are excellent and the food in the restaurants is top class. We ate in the hotel in the evenings 4 out of the seven nights because the food was of such a high standard. The service was good, but it seemed that the hotel was running a couple of people short all the time. This meant the staff were always rushing about and would often forget to bring you something you had requested. Not a major problem, but got a bit annoying if you were waiting for a fork while your food had been served. We also noticed other guests becoming frustrated because they had asked for items and seemed to be forgotten too.The weather was good for us so we did not spend much time in the…",4
"Very relaxing time, excellent pool and spa, afternoon tea could do better, keep the tradition and use a cake stand. Very pleasant staff, wonderful view from the 2nd floor Spa Rooms. Don't like breakfast buffets 4-5 star should cook breakfast to order.                                                               ",4
"I stayed in this hotel in July on a secret escapes package, overall we had a pleasant experience, the only issue we had was that the rooms were very drafty and also quite noisy as you could here plainly the conversations going on in the rooms on either side of you. The waether was not great during out stay and we tried to get the heating in the room working without success, The room we were allocated was interconnected to another and the cold draft that came under the door from the room next door was very annoying, that being said once you were in bed it was fine. In generally the staff were friendly and helpful. We had breakfast included in our meal and the choice of hot and cold items were pretty good. The sun shone on our last day and we were able to sit outside on their…",4
"The Hotel is very large and even though it was reasonably full the weekend I stayed it was very quiet walking around. I stayed in a Spa room which is situated in the more recently refurbished part of the Hotel. Room was spacious and decorated in a modern minimalistic style. My room had a balcony to sit out on facing St Helier. Breakfast was very good, great selection of cold and hot food served buffet style. Good attentive service by all staff. Kept tidy and stocked up.  The spa facility in the Hotel is luxurious !! very well designed with an infinity style large swimming pool, other pools are also available. We did not try out and treatments although on offer were a wide range at additional cost. The town centre is about 30 minutes walk away.  I would recommend this Hotel and…",5
"As a couple, we booked a 5 night stay - they only had their `Spa Rooms' available so not the lowest price.  These rooms are in the Spa end of the hotel and have balconies with views and are extremely spacious and light.  It was well worth the extra cost of the room. The staff are consistently polite, attentive, friendly and very helpful.  When we asked to book a taxi after checking out, they offered to take us to the ferry harbour in the hotel minibus. There are two restaurants - we ate in the `Garden View' one.  It was excellent food at a reasonable price and, again, with friendly service.   Breakfast was very good too. The swimming pool and spa area is spacious and light and is a very relaxing place to spend any time you aren't exploring Jersey.  We would definitely make a…",5
"Lovely hotel, friendly and helpful staff everywhere. Our 1st floor room was large with two big single beds connected together, two armchairs and three large fully opening windows. Good sized en-suite as well. Didn't use the spa  or Saffrons restaurant as very expensive but the pool area is great, plenty of loungers outside on the terrace and garden and the food was good and generous for breakfast and restaurant. Shuttle bus to town was very useful. No complaints and recommend the hotel as a town base.",5
"This hotel exceeded our expectations, we only had a standard room, but it had beautiful views across Jersey.  The room was spotless and well equipped.  We enjoyed the spa pool and gym, a great added extra. We also ate in the Garden View Restaurant several times and it is very good value for money, particularly the lunchtime menu.  But I think most of all what makes the hotel is the staff.  They are a credit to the owners, nothing is too much trouble and they are always polite.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to our family and friends and hope to visit again in the future.  One other mention for the taxi driver, Robert who took us to the airport early in the morning on the day of departure, apparently a regular driver for the Hotel de France, he was a delight and a…",5
"Great hotel and better than we thought it could be (even though all the reviews said it was good). Peaceful and quiet, excellent official polite service. Fantastic terrace bar and a restaurant that was first class. If I return to Jersey will certainly consider staying there again. Excellent 4 days. Highly recommend this hotel. Only slight negative was issues with the lifts for a couple of days otherwise superb!",5
"Great hotel, good food in both restaurants (Saffrons was an exceptional experience with considerable originality), great fresh proper bread at breakfast, fantastic spa/pool & nice terrace. Very good location with appropriate parking.               ",5
"I believed the hotel would have been better than it was from the pictures on the website. It does look pretty impressive but our room was very basic looking out of the window onto the roof of a metal shed.  It was very clean and tidy and the staff were very welcoming. The hotel has lots of facilities from 3 restaurants, hair salon, gym and a spa.  I would stay again but I was expecting more of a wow factor to match the external building. I would however stay again as it was a good clean room.   Breakfast was very good value for money and very good range available.  Spa swimming facilities were free for guest but the pools were extremely cold so I avoided. ",4
"Good reception, quite good rooms, decent breakfast, amazing spa but we have to say that the garden view restaurant needs a lot of improvements on the staff. Really really really slow service even when is not busy. Waiting more than 40 minutes for a dish and more then 20 for a drink.. All the people are really nice I have to say but the service is not... For the price we spent we were expecting a LOT more. Good experience but the last one in this hotel. ",3
"Second time visiting, first time we had a spa room which was lovely and modern with aircon and balcony. This time had to book room in original part of hotel as children not allowed in spa rooms for safety. Room was a bit shabby for the star rating, 80s gold taps, worn bathroom fittings and no aircon, just a desk fan. Spa rooms a little bit more per night but worth the extra in my opinion. Breakfast good and swimming pool/ gym excellent as in new part. I would urge the management to start refurbing the old rooms to keep up with expectations of customers.",3
This was our first holiday to Jersery. We had a lovely holiday the hotel staff where always very helpful the breakfast was excellent we would stay here again. Jersery is a lovely island with lots of places to visit.       ,5
This is a large impressive hotel with a modern spa attached. The breakfasts were well prepared with a wide choice available. We also ate in the Garden View restaurant which had good food at reasonable prices. Everywhere was scrupulously clean and the staff were very friendly. The room we were allocated was a 'Spa' room which has a very contemporary feel but the balcony doesn't make you want to sit out on it.,4
We spent 11 nights at this hotel and throughly enjoyed every minute. We had lovely Executive rooms that were very spacious and well equipped. The rooms had wonderful views over St Helier. The spa and hotel pool were top class. The gym was good although hotel residents do not have access to the very fancy kit there were still plenty of machines available. The staff were absolutely brilliant and are a credit to the hotel. The Saffron restaurant looked nice but was too pricey for our tastes. The other restaurant was excellent and served a good range of food to a very high quality. Breakfast was very good with a very wide range of choice from cooked to continental varieties.  The hotel has a lovely relaxed feel to it. It feels up market but under stated at the same time. It is a…,5
Bedrooms were badly arranged. Old fashioned bathroom with shower over bath and shower curtain. No trouser press. Very poor quality breakfast and  cooked food tasted like it had been cooked ages before and left on a hot table. One good thing about breakfast was the fresh bread. I wouldn't use this Hotel again. ,3
"We Stayed here again for our summer holidays after staying last year. Can't fault any thing, we will return again! A great base to the rest of the island. Fantastic standard of service and amazing breakfasts!!",5
"The hotel is situated a little way out of St Helier, about a 10 minute, easy walk into town.  Although we didn't use it, the hotel does provide a shuttle bus which runs several times a day.  The building itself is beautiful and grand with a nice garden area equipped with sunloungers and umbrellas, and terraces where you can sunbathe or eat and drink.  Our room was at the back of the hotel so we didn't have a view and it was a little dark.  On first appearance the room was just OK, but it did grow on me over our 4 night stay as I came to realise it had everything we needed, including a really good hairdryer, bathrobes, lots of tea and coffee, etc.  The only real downside was that the pillows were a bit hard for me but I believe that reception will swap these if you ask.  There…",4
"We had a very pleasant and comfortable stay in the hotel along with exelent service from the helpful and smiling staff. The food was first class as were the rest of the facilities. All in all a very enjoyable shot stay, we will certainly be back in the future",5
Visted this beautiful old hotel for 5days in July with my elderly mum. Set about 15 mins walk from the marina this hotel is just beautiful easy walking once the steps down to the road have been negotiated.  The room was large and very nice with views of St Helier and the marina.  The spa was very relaxing and worth using. We ate in the garden view bistro each night . The food was lovey and good value for money.  This hotel is a idea base for a stay in Jersey . ,5
"Our penthouse suite was superb!  The level of furnishings, quality bathroom facilities and views are fantastic! Breakfast was spot on, full english, pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, toast - what more could you want?! Ayush Spa was great too.              ",5
"Our 4th time at HdF as a family of 4 (4 & 8 year old children) & having adjoining rooms on floor 2 which were outstanding. Room was exceptionally clean, spacious and in excellent condition. Breakfast was plentiful, flavoursome & hot every day of our 10 day holiday. Our family love Jersey and it is without question that we stay in HdF each year. Great location in St Helier within a short walk (flat after leaving hotel & around 1 mile to the shopping centre) there is also a courtesy bus for hotel guests every 2 hours. The leisure facilities are superb & the pool area is extremely well maintained and relaxing. Staff are all well trained and very helpful and always greeted us with a friendly nature. We would definitely recommend this hotel as an excellent base for a holiday in…",5
It's not cheap but if you want somewhere to stay at the higher end if the market then this is the place. We had breakfast included and it was great - had everything that you could possibly want. The Garden View restaurant was good with a fairly limited menu but we found enough for our needs as we tended to eat our evening meal in St Helier. The prices of the food and drinks are on the high side but if cost was a prohibitive factor then this hotel would not have been chosen in the first place. I would stay again without any hesitation.,4
"I stayed at the Hotel De France from 14th to 18th August 2015 with was fabulous.  The hotel is large but very nice.  The staff were very polite, friendly and very helpful.  The spa and terrace were a lovely place to sit and relax in the sun.  Evening meals very good in the restaurant.  It is situated on the outskirts of St Helier about a 12 minute walk.  The hotel has a shuttle bus but it is just as easy to get a bus or a taxi to and from.  Would definitely return.",5
"The hotel is in a fantastic location, it's elevated above St Helier so the views are amazing (we stayed in room 265, which is huge ) and is a lovely 10 minute stroll to town.  The staff are very helpful & discrete, you hardly know they are there until you need them.  The gardens and terrace are beautiful, with lovely comfortable furniture.  Saffron is a must if you Stay here, it's probably the nicest meal I've ever eaten & the service is exceptional.  The Spa is to die for, we had a massage (not cheap but worth every penny!)  We will be back for more luxury - thanks to everyone for making our anniversary very special",5
"Just had a lovely relaxing week at the De France, excellent staff always polite ,friendly and helpful . Meals excellent and well priced and the pool and spa area a must everyday to unwind. Well done ,international hotel groups need to stay here once in a while as this hotel is what they should be aiming for.",5
"I stayed here with my husband and toddler for a short break. Having previously visited pre-child I had high expectations after staying in a Spa Room. Unfortunately you cannot stay in a Spa Room with a child (not sure why but if it is to do with the balcony in a Spa Room, the windows in our recent room could open so wide a child could easily climb out and I saw as more of a hazard than the balcony in the Spa Room) so had a room at the back of the hotel. The room was a little tired with old double glazing that needed replacing and a carpet that had stains on it. The bathroom was very old and tired. I certainly wouldn't rate this room as 4 star. On the plus side the breakfasts were great, swimming pool a plus and the staff were friendly and welcoming.",3
"Hotel was a delight.  Comfortable, spacious and elegant building. Lot of great areas to sit and relax - terrace a delight - especially for a drink after dinner. Spa a real bonus and we made the most of this, going a couple of times a day.  Had a great massage too. Breakfast very good. Found breakfast room not quite as well decorated/furnished as rest of hotel. Looked a bit corporate. Nothing terrible though.  Staff very helpful. Replaced my firm pillows with soft ones straight away. Nothing too much trouble. Courtesy bus very handy for going down to harbour area.   Would recommend to all. Already have actually!!",5
"Stayed 5 nights , staff very pleasant , we thought the spa treatments where a bit high. Housekeeping excellent  food good. Beautiful gardens to relax in. Staff supplied us with very comfortable sun loungers.       ",4
I've been here 4 times and it is superb. Rooms are brilliant. Great breakfast and friendly staff. In addition the spa and pools are great. This hotel has always made my holiday to Jersey a magnificent trip. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. I will be back this year.,5

I would definately return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone who wishes to have a high class hotel break.",5
Was taking part in charity ride event and having stayed before knew my bike would be safe at the Hotel de France. Excellent staff on front desk who were very helpful and knowledgable. Free shuttle bus was a great addition on a rainy night to get into town. Finally a great nights sleep ready for next day. Certainly a place I will stay again       ,5
We recently enjoyed  short break to Jersey and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting relaxation and great customer service. Wonderful spa treatments as a luxury and I really recommend the signature facial. Great food in all the restaurants              ,5
Lovely hotel. Rooms were tidy and the grounds are fantastic. It was sunny so sunbathed on the loungers. Only a short walk from the pier. Staff were friendly and attentive. Would definitely stay again.        ,4

Had a lovely short break in Jersey and stayed at this hotel. It was lovely. Staff very friendly and courteous. Room immaculate. Had intended to go into town to eat but we're so tired after sightseeing all day that we ate in the hotel every night. Food was excellent. Would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel De France.,5

"This was my second stay here, Stayed here for two nights 20th July, a stunning hotel, the staff could not do enough to accommodate, room was spotless, the grounds of the hotel are Stunning, food in the bistro was fantastic, and  reasonably priced.  All in all this is a gem of a hotel from start to finish. ",5
"This hotel is the first hotel we stayed in on our first visit to Jersey. We have seen many changes and improvements in our many years visiting the island. The staff are very accommodating and nothing is a problem. Rooms are bright, clean and modern. The spa and pool areas are very relaxing and on warm days the glass walls are removed to open the pool up to the gardens where you can relax in the sun. It is situated within walking distance of the town but the hotel runs transport to and from the town if needed.  We highly recommend Hotel De France.",5
"Stayed B and B at The Hotel De France early July for a short break!  Comfortable 2nd Floor twin room with views over the garden, The Town and even distant sea views, Very clean room, Great Maid service, Good air conditioning,Good wireless internet. Fantastic pool facilities. All staff very pleasant and helpful, Breakfast very good selection and quality! Handy shuttle bus in to town centre and back.  Highly recommended!",5
"Lovely, comfortable, clean Hotel, great facilities.  We have stayed several times; however we found they had slightly changed their breakfast location which was not as comfortable. If you have mobility problems, this may not be the hotel for you, as there are a lot of steps to negotiate before getting to the entrance (if you are hiring a car, this won't be an issue).  Would recommend this hotel - the more expensive Spa rooms are excellent.",4
"The hotel is an impressive building. well kept with good furnishings.  We had room 323  Large and comfortable with a good seating area and plenty of storage room. There were large windows with town views. A portable AC unit though it was not really necessary for our stay!  Throughout our stay the service in all departments was excellent, friendly and efficient. Breakfast served in the Orangery was very good, plenty of choice for both hot and cold buffet. The Garden View restaurant had a very enjoyable extensive menu reasonably priced and always served with a smile. It has to be said that the location does not suit less mobile guests.   The hotel shuttle while much appreciated does not run very often. A well run hotel with excellent staff.",5
"We stayed for one week in July.   The room was very good; breakfast was excellent, dining in the Aroma restaurant not so good. The main difficulty stemmed from the poor English of some of the waiting staff. They were in the main very willing and trying to be helpful but a few were limited by poor language skills. There were also some basic errors in table service (e.g.at breakfast, bringing the second course and leaving it on the table before the first course was finished).  If you want to use the gym, you might want to check that it offers what you are looking for. While we were there the provision changed from a gym offered by the hotel itself, which had several running machines, rowers, cross trainers etc and adequate floor space in which to exercise, to a gym provided by…",4
"Never,Never stay in this Hotel! The Hotel Management is totally inflexible  In their guest relations...the check out time was an old-fashioned 11am..the Manager was not prepared to extend even by 10 Minutes! Also if you like sleeping on a slope Hotel de France beds will help you defy the laws of gravity and slide down onto the floor!",1
We had a lovely stay at the Hotel de France. The only downside was the hill up to the hotel. Great hotel for touring the island and only a short walk into Town just be prepared for the steps back up to the hotel       ,4
"The first impression of this imposing hotel is that it is very well maintained with a friendly and welcoming staff.our room, facing the front and hence sea view had air conditioning which, although not needed,was a bonus, excellent swimming pool and gardens to relax in. Restaurants good only minus point, which applies elsewhere, is that it was a pity that smokers gather outside beneath bedroom windows with the unpleasant result.  Will happily return again",4
"we had recommended 3 other couples and this trip was very poor. Disgraceful service in the restaurant, over inflated prices for evening meals. Not enough attention to pre booking room selection. A bad experi       ",2
"The high standard of this hotel made up for the fact that st helier isn't the prettiest spot on the island. We couldn't fault the hotel at all, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff made it a very enjoyable four night stay. The spa area and pool with a lovely terrace and garden is a great place to enjoy the sunshine. We would recommend you hire a car and explore this fantastic little island, lots of great beaches and a variety of places to eat, from beach side cafés to pubs and restaurants. We'd definitely return.       ",5
"This is a fabulous hotel, well located and convenient. Service is brilliant, the pool is incredible and the wifi is excellent. The food is delightful - especially in Saffrons although the newly named Garden View and Terrace restaurant is well worth a visit.       ",5
"Stayed for a few days with my daughter in a spa room. When we arrived the room wasn't ready so we left the luggage and went for a walk. When we returned we were told our luggage was in our room and given directions to get there. We were sent to the wrong lift and it took us two phone calls and a return to reception for a lovely young lad, Elliot,  to actually take us to our room and give a running commentary about the hotel amenities. When we got to our room, no luggage but a phone call soon sorted that out. At all times reception staff were friendly and efficient although the hotel was far from full so don't know how it would be if they had lots of customers to see to. The room was large but oddly sparse looking. it didn't give the impression of plush or comfortable but looked…",3
"Visited in July 2015 as a couple. The hotel entrance is good, the room was OK, no more than that, but the bed was narrow (4'6"") and was high mileage so that you both rolled into the middle. The pool area is fabulous, but the BIG negative was the Garden View Restaurant. Overpriced food we could cope with,but the service was APPALLING, we waited 1½ hours for our meals to arrive. Overall, I would rate it as 5 out of 10.",3
A delightful hotel set in a convenient location. Took a little time to find it but that was due to the confusing one way system in St Helier. The building is very old but the accommodation is first class. All the staff are very pleasant and go out of their way to assist. We only had breakfast in the hotel but this offered a comprehensive selection and even the hot food buffet style was like freshly cooked food. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.,4
"Very helpful staff in all parts of the hotel. The room was a bit small, but had a great view. A big attraction was the swimming pool / sauna / spa area. Perfect for a rainy day, or with an outside terrace for a sunny day. It's a bit of a walk into town but there is a bus stop outside. The walk from the street up to the hotel is a bit of a killer after a hard day's sightseeing! The two restaurants and breakfast is all good. The speciality restaurant is a bit pricey, as is the beer.",5
"Hotel is a good walk into St helier but there are complimentary shuttle buses daily. Situated on a steep hill so not for the infirm. Stayed in spa room 210, nice views over St helier with balcony, decent sized room with good shower, free safe and nice quality toiletries. Breakfast lovely, great variety and all the spread was of a decent quality. Beautiful terrace and garden area which is lovely to sit out with a drink (weather permitting). Spa/pool is beautiful one of the best I've been in, spacious and relaxing with top notch sauna, steam room, plunge pool, jacuzzi, pool and hot pool. All the staff are polite and charming nothing is to much trouble. I didn't eat in the restaurant but other guests said it was good and it certainly looked appetising. I would without a doubt stay…",4
"My girlfriend and I stayed here recently for 2 nights (Fri / Sat) and overall we were happy. The Spa area is lovely and the reception staff very helpful its a shame we cannot say the same about the restaurant staff.   On the Friday evening we went into their terraced eatery and after waiting for 5 mins we were taken to a nice table outside however after 15 minutes we were still waiting for menu's let alone a drinks order - Several other tables were also without menu's or drinks.  I asked the waiter what was going on and he said that on busy periods they could not offer fast service, When I asked would we have at least a drinks order taken within half an hour he said ""unlikely"" so we walked to town and had a lovely meal elsewhere - Disappointing, If its busy (and it obviously…",3
The hotel was recommended to us and we enjoyed our 4 day trip.  Minor quibbles: Double rooms are quite small  No air conditioning although a fan was provided in the room  Positives: Fantastic welcoming & attentive staff Lovely leisure facilities with a great pool and sauna area Very attractive outdoor seating area   Would stay there again,4
"We first visited this hotel for our honeymoon in 1985 and decided to return to celebrate our 30th anniversary. We were not disappointed.  The room was very clean and well decorated. The staff were very welcoming and friendly.  We went for the tasting menu in the Saffron dining room and it was extremely well presented and tasted delicious, the wines and beers complimented it very well.    The facilities are excellent .  ",4
"I was curious to read a review from a few days ago saying they got a basic room but had paid little. We have a basic room, but paid a lot! First trip to Jersey. The breakfast is good and the breakfast staff are fine too. The pool and leisure centre are excellent and the rooms clean. The hotel's site does not mention the steep ramp or the numerous steps up to the entrance. I have a disability, which I mentioned in our initial reservation enquires, so this fact should be clear on their site. I never received any reply from my reservation requests. On our first day we ate in the hotel's Garden View restaurant. Abysmal service and average food. The second evening there was a barbecue set up, the place seemed busier and more promising so we stupidly said we would dine here again as…",2
"married couple, mid 60s, first time in Jersey. We booked this hotel through Expedia as part of a four night bed and breakfast deal. Hotel is located just 15 minutes stroll from St Helier town centre. The hotel exteria and gardens are beautiful but the interior is still 1930s period which, perhaps, adds to it's olde-world charm (tickets for luggage held in the porters lodge, you don't get that everywhere). reception staff were always friendly and helpful. Public areas and toilets were always clean and tidy. Our room was fairly comfortable but quite basic which was fine considering we were on a relatively cheap package deal. However, we coud hear the two very loudly spoken ladies in the room next door through the adjoining wall and a connecting door (I never like to see those…",4
"I ve been coming to the hotel de france for 4 years, always a pleasure, the spa is fantastic.  Good range of breakfast, bus to town is great. Good location. Staff are welcoming and progessional. Look forward to my next trip                     ",5
"This was my first trip to Jersey and only had Guernsey hotels as a comparison  The hotel is large and expansive, I didn't use the majority of the facilities only being there on business, so my review is limited to the rooms only.  Pros Decent pillows Some English sky channels  Cons Thin walls I heard somebody next door snoring all night Slept with the window open but you get kitchen breakfast cooking and seagull noises Small rooms Fairly small bathrooms Limited closet space Uneven floors  If I was to return to Jersey I would for an alternative ",3
stayed here for 1 night for work the room was comfortable and clean. the view wasnt great but i slept well despite it being 36 degrees during the day. the spa was great and well worth using as was the out door terace attached,5
I booked this hotel while visiting a friend in Jersey as it's located just 10 minutes walk from St Helier and came recommended by friends on the island.  The hotel facade and gardens are beautiful but the interior is perhaps a little dated - for some I'm sure it adds to the charm. You get what you pay for with rooms; ours was comfortable but basic which I was fine with considering how little we paid! I'm sure if you were booking for a special occasion or holiday you could upgrade your room as I understand others are really lovely. For me it was simply a place to sleep after meals and drinks in St Helier so was more than adequate. The Onsite spa was a huge bonus for us! After relaxing in the pool we treated ourselves to Ayush massages in the wellness spa which were wonderful. For…,4
"This was our 2nd stay at Hotel de France - the previous occasion was Oct 2011 when we were lucky enough to be given a free upgrade to an executive room. No such luck this time but we were still very impressed overall with the hotel, the facilities, location and service. The front-desk staff are very keen to help in any way possible, answer your enquiries in full and give as much information as possible - perhaps a bit too much at times. Nevertheless our room was spacious, clean, comfortable and had a great panoramic view over St Helier - it was a pity the windows weren't wider and more open. We requested a fridge in our room which was delivered in double-quick time. Breakfasts were always something to look forward to with a wide range of dishes, comfortable surroundings and…",4
"The hotel façade is very grand although let down a little by the Car park at one side and the spa at the other which look as if they have just been stuck on each end.  The room we had was also not quite as grand as our first view led us to believe.  I am being picky however as overall our stay was excellent.  The spa is fantastic, food was great and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  It's also a great base for travelling around the island and within walking distance of the town centre and harbour area.  There is also a great area at the front for relaxing outdoors, especially at night when the weather is good.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
"Friendly, helpful  staff. Lovely room.   Great food in Saffrons.  Food and service in Cafe Aroma good too.  The spa was super and treatment very relaxing. Relatively easy walk in town and sea but a  final steep walk back to hotel.  Car not essential but definitely a bonus.        ",5
"Beautiful grounds and facilities await you at this hotel.  It is a pleasant stroll in to St Helier, or there is a hotel shuttle.  The position makes the hotel much quieter than  being in central St Helier.",4
"A fabulous well appointed 4 star hotel on a great island. Brilliant Spa facilities. Good quality rooms, bar and restaurants . Staff are very friendly and professional  A bit of a trek to the seafront but well worth it",5
"Fabulous hotel with amazing swimming pool.Spacious gardens and terraces.Spacious rooms and good food.Only down side was no air conditioning in rooms,and as weather was so hot it made it rather uncomfortable during the night.",5
"The hotel is very grand and the rooms are very comfortable. The Ayush spa is wonderful offering a wide range of treatments. Beautiful swimming pool, spa and sauna. Beautiful restaurants and wonderful food available.                                   ",5
"What a wonderful hotel. Will definitely love to come back, staff lovely, grounds although quite small were nice and the spa was just amazing especially when they had the doors open on the patio area...              ",5
"The Hotel de France is a lovely well run Hotel.  Breakfast had everything you could possibly want.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable but unfortunately our was situated above the kitchen and if you left the window open the smell was rather overpowering, garlic and fish are not nice odours to have in your room.  The bathroom was modern and clean pristine white replacements every morning.  Gardens were a pleasure to sit in with plenty of loungers available.  I didn't use the Spa or swimming pool but they looked really good.  My only concern is the rather steep climb from the road to the reception area which is not stated in any literature and I know that alderly or infirm guest would have grwat difficulty.  The courtesy bus into town was very useful but you had to make…",5
"Great hotel. A little out of town but this didn't matter as we had a hire car. Resteraunts were fine, breakfast buffet was a great start to the day. Free parking was always available , plenty of room as the hotel never felt crowded even though it was busy.",4
"Stayed here for a couple of nights in June. Room was very clean and modern and free wifi was good. Drinks prices were standard and food and service was really good. Hotel is about 10 mins walk  from town centre and around 10-15 to walk to the beach. I would recommend this hotel for being clean, modern, good service and good location and I would happily stay there again.",5
"Great facilities  and the staff were fantastic probably the most attentive I, as a disabled  traveller, have come across. The town is lovely and the restaurant  by the gates of the fish market  served  the best fish ever.                                   ",5
"Just returned from 4 nights at this Hotel. Wonderful, is the best way to describe it.  The Hotel is in a great setting with views across the town to the sea. The facilities are great; Swimming pool complex, restaurants. The suite we had was - so we were told - the best they have and I cannot disagree! This is definitely one of the best Hotels on the Island. It was full but the staff and service was excellent - well done.",5
"Beautiful hotel, spacious, friendly, clean and very helpful staff. Food in the general restaurant was good, reasonably priced. Was a wait sometimes due to often only being 2 - 3 members of staff on duty but we were in no rush. We didn't try the posh restaurant t as out of our budget. The pool area was lovely, supplied towels, the showers were great along with some shampoo/gel and proper hairdryer in the changing room.The hill up to the building would be a problem for people with mobility issues, however they do run a minibus into the town which is only a mile away. We walked into the town to try other eateries on the harbour which is being expanded, has a very cosmopolitan feeling. Bedrooms were reasonable size, lovely huge bath towels, smellies replaced daily as were the coffee…",5
"Our trip started off rather unpleasant when we failed to land in Jersey because of bad fog. We only arrived a day later when the fog had cleared and what started off as a trip from hell was turned into a fantastic holiday when we arrived at Hotel de France. We were greeted with such a warm welcome and assisted with the utmost respect, empathy and professionalism. Through out our stay we got assistance regarding places to eat, taxis, nightlife and tours. Would definitely go back to the same hotel on my next visit to Jersey ",5
"I have been traveling to this island for more than thirty years.  If you want a fantastic sea view then this is probably not the ideal hotel. However, if you want a hotel with a one of the best indoor pool and spa’s on the island, along with a nice wow factor then this is a great hotel. Lots of parking space. (not something that you get with the majority of hotels on these islands) and only a few minutes away from the centre of St Helier with all its wonderful sites. Main restaurant a bit expensive for us, but the ground floor bistro offers a great range of dishes Right up to late evening. If you do not want to include breakfast, then just have a very nice yoghurt or cereal breakfast in the bistro at a fraction of the cost. We always walk into town as our evening treat anyway as…",5
"What a lovely hotel, room no. 260 had a view of St Helier and had everything we needed and was really good value.  We stayed for 4 nights 23 to 27 June 2015. The staff are so friendly nothing too much trouble. Breakfast excellent. Hotel is on a hill quite a few steps to climb so if you are not too clever on your feet get a taxi or hotel shuttle bus back.",5
"We have stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago, the hotel and amenities were nice, check in ok, breakfast good, rooms clean and quiets. The problem came the next day, we have asked for a late check out at 15:00 local, and the check in staff said yes, we didn't mind even if we have to pay extra to stay longer at the hotel, we were heading to work and we wanted to rest as much as we could. Around midday we all got a call from a lady, with a demanding a rude attitude, saying that we have to leave the rooms immediately, we explained that we had asked for a late check out but she didn't care, so we said that we were not ready and we had to pack our stuff, to get an answer from her ""do it quickly because you have to leave the room"" Later I meet my colleagues at the reception and found…",3
"Chose this hotel based on the reviews. I booked directly with reception by phone, which was easy and the same price as advertised on the web. It was our anniversary and we had fresh fruit, flowers and prosecco awaiting us with their compliments. The hotel is elegant and impressive, clean and comfortable. The facilities are excellent..from pool / spa to shuttle bus and parking and are all included. The WiFi is good and no fuss. The breakfast is especially worth mentioning, fresh good quality and plentiful. The choice is extensive and some things like omelette or fish cooked to order. Cafe Aroma (see separate review) is excellent and the staff throughout are friendly and helpful.  The position commands good views, it is 15 mins walk from town and up a hill but not a problem for…",5
"this hotel is well staffed with polite ,cheerful and helpful staff in every department . the comfort is of a high quality as is the food and service. The hotel sits high above the town of St Helier and is at least a 15 minute walk into town where all he facilities are ,for eg restaurants,cinema,port bus station but the location of the hotel is the best in St Helier.",5
"Excellent service throughout. Good facilities and  grounds, excellent food with very friendly and attentive waiters and waitresses.Very clean hotel with a friendly reception desk. Situation was a 12 minute walk from the front, but transport was also available if needed.Spaces available to park cars.Would certainly revisit this hotel and recommend it.       ",5
"A beautiful hotel, the additional block blends in well.  Shame about the office block/clinic in front of the hotel as it blocks the lovely facade from view.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  The room was lovely but, personal choice, I wouldn't just have those blinds, it needs some drapes to enhance the windows/views. The breakfast was lovely and served in a beutiful light airy restaurant which surprised me in that it seemed only to be used for breakfast and not other meals.  The ground floor restaurant though smallish served  a well prepared and cooked menu.  Saffrons the main restaurant, I have already reviewed separately. The Pools were excellent.  You can be energetic and swim laps [why would anyone?] or like me meander between all 4 pools to your hearts content and…",5
"we found the hotel to be in a good location easy to find, great first impression when you arrive up the entrance drive very large and impressive entrance hall staff were very pleasant on arrival, it has a large terrace to sit and eat and drink and a nice garden to relax in. lovely infinity pool, sauna,and steam room,The food in the restaurant is of a very good standard. you can walk into the centre of jersey in about 20 minutes",5
Lovely hotel with spa (expensive) and restaurant (breakfast at £12.50 was steep!). They run a shuttle service to the town in the mornings but return is by request. It took about 15-20 minutes to walk into town but getting back the drive is very steep. Good parking. Bear in mind that to park in Jersey at many designated spots will require you to use parking tickets (book of 10 is £7.60) and available in most shops and hotel. Lots of excellent places to eat in the town and outside. Enjoyed the hotel and loved the holiday back where I was born and grew up.  ,4
"If you want butter at breakfast you have to ask for it and when it comes you have to use a microscope to find it. Air conditioning is open your window, and the bathroom and toilet could do with an extractor, otherwise not a bad hotel good location and has a well kept garden and a resident seagull who has a good lifestyle amongst the tables and chairs on the patio!       ",4
"I stay here regularly on business and whilst there are parts of the hotel which are a bit dated, it is clean and comfortable and the staff are very friendly. Also the wifi is free and good all over which as a business traveller is very important to me.        ",4
"The room size depends on the room you book. So it's worth reading the comments before booking. We chose a SPA room and got a huge new room (beautifully funrnished) with a view over the bay. Sunset included.  There is a range in staff friendlyness at the reception. We got everything from more than friendly and helpful to an okay-ish nod an a few words. The staff at the restaurant was very friendly and always up for a joke or a short conversation. The service was impeccable and we felt very much at ease.  The hotel is not in the centre, but this is something you can find out before you book and then decide whether that's fine with you or not. We were totally fine with it - just  ask at the reception for the best walk into town, and if you do, ask for the one that takes you by the…",5
"It's ok, that's all I can honestly say. The lobby looks great, the reception staff are fine, the rooms look tired in places (bedside light didn't work) and are pretty small. My room didn't have much of a view. The car park spaces and limited and tiny (don't hire a big car!). But that's all run of the mill stuff. What really let the hotel down was an hours wait for food at lunchtime and agin at dinner. No excuse, how long does some bread take to put on a plate with some oil and vinegar after all? Food itself is ok, people on the table next to me complained and demanded the tip be taken off their bill (yes, this is another hotel that auto adds to your bill, and an hours wait doesn't justify a tip). My meal was very average in every way except the price. Fish was over cooked and…",3
We went on the bank holiday weekend in May. Weather on the Saturday was not nice but the receptionist was engaging and before we knew it we were suitably convinced to go to the spa. It is a lovely spa especially the wet area. When our room was ready we got a lovely bright corner room with lovely sea views. All restaurants recommended by the hotel were top class.  The hotel breakfast was lovely really fresh food on the buffet. The hotel design is very English sea side bright colours etc lots of florals for some reason it works.,5
"I stayed here many years ago but found the place much improved since then. The public spaces are well thought out, and there are two lovely restaurants, both recommended. There is also a fantastic looking pools area, which I didn't get a chance to try unfortunately, and a pleasant area to sit or lounge in outside. Breakfasts are taken in the Orangery, which has a completely glass roof through which you can look up to the sky. My bedroom was ok, not dowdy but not particularly modern, and didn't live up to the rest of the hotel. However the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of drawer and wardrobe space, as well as chairs and a long mirror. The only really odd thing were the lights in the bathroom, which were set in a ceiling which must have been 3 metres high!. Impossible…",4
"A lovely room with great views across St. Helier. The service, particularly in the Cafe Aroma was excellent and the food is of the highest quality. There was a slight glitch with the shower that was fixed promptly but, overall, very good indeed. Thankyou.       ",4
"All staff very helpful and always smiling,  Sweets in Café Aroma need improving in variety, some hot  and cold sweets. Breakfast was most enjoyable and a wonderful selection. Room was well fitted out and comfortable.              ",5
"The staff are very helpful, the hotel is well maintained & clean and food at the Aroma Cafe very good. The Spa facilities are excellent. I would have given it a 5 out of 5 if the beds hadn't have been so hard. The hotel has gone for mattress durability rather than comfort - in my opinion.  ",4
Very good choice on Isle of Jersey. Would rate 3 Stars. No air conditioning in room. No problem during our stay. We were in anolder room which had not been renovated. Shuttle bus to Liberation Square.       ,4
"fantastic hotel, great food and staff. Excellent pool and spa. Rooms a little noisy on the 1st floor, but they are clean and suitable. location is good only a short walk from town centre and they provide shuttle bus",4
"Comfortable, clean room, friendly staff. Excellent breakfast. Nice spa facilities. Free parking. Free Wi-Fi which worked well. Short walk (10-15 mins) or wait for shuttle bus into town centre for shops, restaurants etc. We tried both restaurants at the hotel during our stay and were not disappointed - Saffrons in particular was a very memorable meal.",4
"I have recently spent a most enjoyable three days and nights at the Hotel de France, but my goodness what a trip down memory lane! it was my first visit to this delightful and rather quaint island and the Hotel de France fits the bill. I had a comfortable single room but with delightful views from both windows. I only had breakfast whilst I was there, but wow, what a feast. Rooms were spotless and the staff delightful, the spa and pool were a real plus and there's little to find fault with, but I reserve my last star because of the location. The hotel is quite a trek from the town and although there is acurtesy bus throughout the day - that's not always what your looking for and it's quite a drag up out of the town. would I stay again, yes, but at 66 I think I may be a little…",4
"My husband and i have just returned from a three night stay.The hotel was very good with very friendly staff,lovely clean rooms and a great view from our room.The spa was the best we have visited and the terrace great for a drink before dinner.There was no noise at night so got a good sleep.",5
"The room key I had over a 3 night stay stopped working every day, worst at 10pm when my wife had to stand outside our door for 15 mins with our one year old baby whilst I had to get Reception to get it fixed. Granted they were polite aboit fixing it but the problem had already happened.   Worst still last night (13th June) I called for room service (from room 270) and asked for some cordial for my wife. The mam who took my call told me off for not reading the 'in room' menu properly and refused to serve me. I had to walk to the downstairs bar and order it personally.   Lovely venue and some staff very polite but will not return",1
"The hotel is very clean and all the staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. We stayed in a Spa room which I could not fault at all. The room was large, the bed was king size and very comfortable and the bathroom had a bath plus a walk in shower.  We ate in the Aroma cafe on several occasions and found the the food quality was very good for a so called 'pub meal'. The breakfast selection was wide and again the food was excellent (I can recommend the Haddock and poached eggs, cooked to order).  There is a  free courtesy bus that runs several times a day that drops you off in St Hellier and saves the 15 minute walk into town.  The Spa pool and Gym are excellent but I cannot comment on the treatments as they were too expensive for our budget. This was our first time in Jersey…",5
"If I could give this hotel six or seven stars I certainly would. We spent three nights there at the end of May and couldn't fault anything. In my business life over the past forty years I have stayed in hundreds of hotels in Britain and elsewhere so I have a lot to compare. Hotel de France is probably the best and nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Room, food and facilities are as good as anywhere but what so impressed my wife and I was the service and, above all, the friendliness of the staff. Without exception, every member of staff we encountered was just so friendly, but not in an overbearing way.  The hotel is obviously extremely well managed and I will not hesitate to recommend it.",5
"This is the seventh time we have stayed at this hotel, and it just gets better. The staff, without exception are friendly polite and helpful. The breakfast was first class. We had a front facing room on the fourth floor and the view was stunning. The spa facilities are first class.",5
"nice hotel, staff very helpful and friendly. its a 15 minute walk to the bus station or a short trip on the bus to the hotel. the spa is excellent, breakfast is self service . we had a spa room and the bathroom had a nice large bath and a walk in shower. also room has a balcony overlooking the town and the sea.",5
Only £75 for a single room with breakfast so not bad for Jersey.  Location not great in St. Helier.  Very hard mattress on bed.  Excellent breakfast.  Saffron specialty Indian restaurant is extortionate and so is the bar by it - £4.50 for a pint of Heineken.  Much better cafe on found floor where food is sensible prices but a bit mediocre.  Fosters £3.50 a pint in there.,3
"We stayed at the hotel de France for 3 nights on the 1st June. The weather was great! The staff couldn't do enough for us, we asked for a fridge to keep my sons milk in and they brought on up in 30 Mins of asking. There is no mini bar as stated on the websites so if you have a little on this maybe needed. The breakfast was great we only had one bad day there. on Sunday and we wasn't asked if we wanted a tea nor did we have any knifes and forks on the table. But it was the busiest day. I was slightly shocked at the prices of back massages and facials! Its was £85 for a hour or £45 for 20 mins neck massage. This is only offered to quests at the hotel but even still that was London prices! The downside to our whole trip was nothing to do with the hotel but If your driving you need…",5
"We stayed here for 3 nights. We were immediately made to feel welcome, after arriving late.  The service is friendly and responsive. The rooms are well appointed with great views of St Helier and the water. There is a good selection for the breakfast.  This is a small walk from the town, and there are always taxis on standby.",4
"This hotel has a 4 star rating but I would rate it 5 star. The staff were very friendly and knowledgable, the food was excellent (we had only intended to eat there on the first night but ate there every evening). The breakfast selection and presentation was excellent, the room (although only a standard room) was very clean, spacious and well decorated. The spa/pool area was one of the best I have found in a hotel. The whole ambience of the hotel is one of peace and tranquillity. Having stayed in hotels all over the world I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all my friends.",5
"Couldn't be better for service. Nothing was too much trouble. Headboard didn't really fit the bed, but I didn't complain as anyone can make a mistake and I have no doubt that if I had it would have been rectified.",5
"We stayed at this hotel in May 2015. Family of 4 in an interconnecting room on a bed & breakfast rate. The positives which way outweigh the negatives were; The staff are excellent and could not have been more pleasant. The Spa is lovely Cleanliness all over hotel The breakfast was excellent and set us up for the day (inc the kids)  The negatives, which sounds as though I'm labouring on them but none of which would prevent me from going again, are really just feedback on what prevented this holiday from being perfect. Hopefully the hotel will find useful; The location of the hotel is definitely geared to having a hire car. It is a good 10 min walk into town. (not the hotels fault) The service for drinks from the bar as a bit slow I was disappointed that my daughters were told…",4
"Have stayed here twice before and always in the Spa rooms. On both occasions I was looked after and felt very welcome. I would also add that the Spa rooms are superb, with very comfortable beds, a nice sized room and a superbly large bath; I wanted to stay longer and looked forward to coming back (room 212 and 206).  On this visit however the Spa rooms were fully booked and I ended up in a double room (311) which was tiny, the bed was awful, the cistern drips continously and all I could hear were the people in the rooms and corridor banging around me!   To top it off the thoroughly rude barman in the Safron bar annoyed me so much we walked out and instead of leaving a positive review (which I enjoy more than these) I'm leaving this review. As we walked in we said hi and were…",3
"We have stayed at this hotel twice before but its been 10 years since our last visit. The reception is very good friendly and informative.  Our room was a spa room with balcony very spacious and lovely views. We ate in the hotel twice, we had steak the first night it was lovely , the service was also very good and attentive and good value. The food on the last night was equally lovely. Breakfast was also very good quality and a very relaxed affair an excellent choice. The pool and spa also looked lovely. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. ",4
"A beautiful hotel pool is amazing our room was very nice,breakfast was very good,one disappointment was with the restaurant we waited a long time for any service another couple came in and were served straight away ,so we left and went else where for dinner,but would definitely go again soon i hope.

"Great hotel with attentive staff, room good size and comfortable.bed. Disappointed with selection of TV channels available. Gym spectacular and spa large and well appointed, with a great pool. Food excellent ate in Saffron spectacular Indian fusion food               ",5
"We stayed in an Executive Room and this was excellent value for money.  The room was large with a King size bed and an adjoining sitting area, separate dressing room and bathroom.  Very clean and comfortable.    The staff were excellent - friendly, helpful and genuinely interested that we enjoyed our stay.  All the amenities you would expect from a larger hotel (pool, spa, restaurants, bars, terrace, garden, garage, secure bike storage, etc) but run with a family feel.",5
"We had a fab time. The spa is excellent, especially the pool for the kids. The staff are really friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Everything was done with a smile. The food was also great. We ate in Cafe Aroma. It was relaxed but the quality was superb.                             ",5
"we stayed for 6 nights in a very spacious spa room, so glad we chose a room with balcony as we had marvellous weather so was worth the extra money. Word of warning don't touch the mini bar unless you intend to use them as you will be charged. The bed was very comfortable although I found the pillows to be awful they need to invest in nice big fluffy ones being a 4 star hotel!! Every single member of staff we encountered were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough for you. What made our stay was the pool area it was lovely and relaxing and never crowded, so we could use the pool and sunbathe on the terrace or garden. The hotel could do with another bar area as not much atmosphere in the lounge bar and the bar in café aroma is more for diners. Breakfast is very good with great…",5
My wife & I are Jersey residents and through a burst mains water pipe we had to move from our home to allow tradesmen put our home together again. Our daughter contacted Hotel de France requesting a room with walk in shower for my wife as she suffers from back problems. They provided a super room with a balcony and view over the town. The staff welcomed us and provided first class service with excellent food and amenities. We can recommend this hotel as a  great place to visit if you enjoy visiting a hotel that makes you feel at home.,5
"What struck us from the moment we arrived at the Hotel De France was the professionalism and friendliness of all the staff at this hotel. We stayed for seven nights on bed and breakfast basis in a spa room with a balcony overlooking the town with the coast in the distance, a very nice roomy room with comfortable bed and very nice bathroom.  I used the spa on a number of occasions, the pools were well maintained and offered a relaxation in a clean well run relaxing environment.  We ate in the café aroma a number of times and enjoyed good quality food served by friendly  waiters and waitresses who always had a welcome smile to greet us. We planned to eat in Saffrons one night but circumstances changed and were unable to do this but by all accounts it is well worth a visit.  The…",5
"Visited Jersey for the Spring Walking Week and the 70th anniversary celebrations of Liberation Day. As a regular visitor to the Hotel I received my usual warm welcome and my requested room. Booked B & B at the Hotel (the choice at breakfast is very good) and use it mainly as a base for travelling to all parts of the island . I like the proximity to the town to explore the large choice of restaurants in the evening but did use Café Aroma on a couple of occasions. Also used the courtesy bus a few times to get into or back from the centre of town. I think the Hotel is good value for money, staff are well trained and helpful. Hopefully I will be back in 2016.       ",4
"We have recently returned from a 4 day trip to jersey. The hotel was lovely, it's a large hotel but very quiet, we didn't want to stay in the centre of St helier but it was only a five minute walk to the centre. The hotel does a daily shuttle bus or taxi. We stayed in the spa suite with a balcony and it was beautiful and very clean. The staff are very helpful and lovely. We spent a day in the hotel using the facilities and it was so relaxing. I would definitely stay here again. The food is also very good. Can't fault it.",5
"A great stay at a lovely hotel.  Not in the centre of St Helier, but since we had hired a car, this was not a problem.  I understand there is a shuttle bus to take visitors to and from the hotel to the centre of town.  Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean.  The staff were very good and were ready to help with any requests.  We ate in the Aroma cafe on one evening and enjoyed the food very much.  It was particularly nice to sit on the terrace outside the restaurant and enjoy the views over St Helier.  The breakfast buffet was fine, with plenty of choice.  Free wifi, which worked quickly and easily,  was appreciated.",4
"I have just returned from four days in Jersey with my elderly aunt. The hotel staff were-so helpful. Despite being a large hotel it was a very quiet and peaceful place. Food was excellent. The hotel is in a very good position, away from the busy main town but within easy walking distance, about 10mins walk from the shopping area. For those who find walking difficult the hotel runs a shuttle bus. We had a great stay",5
Not the best location its stuck behind a 70s concrete office block.  The rooms are tired but clean.  The one down side was the hotel was absolutely freezing. My room was really cold and when we had a drink in the bar it was also very draughty and cold.  One of the down sides of an old building.  The staff are very helpful and St Helier itself was great for restaurants and bars.,3
"We really enjoyed our stay here; the staff were very pleasant and quickly gave assistance when needed. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive with everything you could want from good quality fresh full English to all the other Continental options. I would definitely stay here again when I revisit Jersey. Thank you, Dave Siswick.",5
"Good  points: . room was a good standard generally. Nothing exceptional but tidy and spacious. . breakfast was good, though a shame the breakfast room doesn't make the most of the beautiful surroundings . service was consistently polite and prompt . the pool was amazing  Less good points: . location is not amazing and a bit of a walk back to town . some hotel areas look tired . food in restaurant was expensive for what it was. But the fish and chips was incredible.",4
One of Jerseys best hotels with a great Spa and leisure centre. The rooms are a good size and well furnished. The bar and restaurants are very good and service is excellent. It is  a little dated but some would say 'Traditional' It is  a fifteen minute walk from Town and in an unusual location but all in all a great hotel,4
"Lovely stay.  Mentioned our anniversary when I reserved a table for dinner and we found champagne, a fruit basket and flowers in our room when we checked in.  Again comfort and relaxation are the bywords for this hotel.  Friendly helpful staff.  We will stay again.",5
Absolutely no atmosphere at all. The Aroma cafe is a restaurant that offers pub grub. The Saffron restaurant has a very limited menu at over the market prices. Rooms comfortable but I had an adjoining door that was so thin I could hear conversations in the other room. Went for a lunchtime drink and told bar doesn't open til 5pm but could use Aroma where you have to sit at a table amongst the diners. Met a friend one evening and invited her back to my room for a fine scotch and was told I couldn't take anyone up to my room after 11pm! There will not be returning,1
"Had a great stay, helpful, polite staff, nice clean room if somewhat small and not super stylish, but perfectly functional. Breakfast was superb and the spa is truly amazing, something that would not be out of place in a 5 star ++ hotel! All in all a great stay at a great price. I will definitely return.       ",5
"We caught the bus from the air port into St helier then had a spot of trouble finding the hotel but after that the experience was good, the staff were friendly, the room was clean and up to the standard of the rest of the hotel, breakfast was tasty and again as expected. Well worth considering if you are planning a stay in St helier.",4
"We stayed at the hotel over the 2015 Liberation Day weekend as part of a hockey tour. We upgraded our room to a Spa room, so I cannot comment on the quality of the other rooms in the hotel. Not all of our party had a Spa room, but as none of the occupants of 11 different rooms made any adverse comment I can only assume that they were happy with the facilities as well.  The Spa room is as described in the particulars, and the photograph on the website clearly shows the bedroom and bathroom layouts as we experienced them. The bedroom was very comfortable, and both rooms were well-cleaned every day of our stay.   We didn’t eat an evening meal in the hotel as we had restaurants booked as part of the holiday, but breakfast was excellent. The staff were attentive and professional, and…",5
Good Sleeps...Is it The Island Air?... Although Had To Remove Mattress Protector On First Night As It Was Causing Excess Perspiration/Sweating. Café Aroma Was VG But Service Not Consistent Regarding Evening Nibbles & Bread Rolls. Cafe Aroma Food & Prices were VG.                                 ,5
"The Hotel de France is spacious and welcoming with a terrific outdoor terrace for food and drinks and really nice pool facilities. I've stayed a number of times and the rooms are of a good standard with plenty of parking space. The reception staff are welcoming, the restaurant staff not always as attentive as I would like.",4
"Great hotel. The pool and spa area is nicely done, relaxing, and quiet enough to enjoy in peace. Room was clean, spacious with modern decoration. But, the big thing with this hotel is the staff and the food. Staff were all really friendly, would have a laugh with you and were extremely polite. And as for the food, well, the cafe steak was one of the best I've had in a long while, really tasty grub. We never saw the gardens or visited the lounge or the Indian restaurant on site. I guess we're going to have to go back! ",5
"We rang up to book two over night stays after looking online and seeing that the Saturday night was booked up. After a bit of conversation, we were offered an executive suite, which we were happy to accept. I then asked to book a table for the restaurant - Saffrons - and was told that the only available times were 14:45 & 15:00; a bit late we thought but not a problem. I then asked to book afternoon tea in the cafe aroma, so the lady on the phone put me through. We booked a table for Saturday afternoon. On arrival, we were greeted at the front desk with a smile and given our room number and key.  We went straight to our room, which was clean and the bed huge but quite sparse. If you are after top-notch decoration, this is not the room for you. It was like it had been forgotten…",4
"This is the second time we have stayed at the Hotel de France, and again we have really enjoyed it, the staff are very polite and friendly, the breakfast is superb and the hotel is very clean, looking forward to the next time we stay.               ",5
"Hotel is very spacious,every space is so much bigger than usual standard. Nice room with usual amenities, nice breakfast and luxury dinner, the Saffron restaurant. However the most remarkable feature of this hotel is the swimming and Sauna area. Reasonably nice swimming pool although not very deep. A couple of other smaller pools with different features but one with bubbling water is really unique. The sauna space has two different rooms, the dry one and the steam room; excellent experience. There is also a Gym upstairs and another coffee - restaurant downstairs. Certainly recommended",5
"We stayed at Hotel De France during the Easter holidays, for 5 days. I have never been to Jersey before but my partner has many times. We booked this hotel through an online deal and got breakfast and one evening meal included.  The hotel was set behind a huge medical building so was quite difficult to find as you cannot see it from the road side. On first impressions the hotel looked very much like a 4 star you would expect - grand entrance, lovely gardens and large well presented entrance hall. The staff were very friendly throughout our stay.   Sadly the rooms were not fantastic -old fashioned, the bathroom could do with being modernised and the walls were paper thin (I could hear the guy next door snoring!)  Breakfast was good -nice selection of cooked/continental foods. Our…",3
The staff was pleasant and professional. The staff who maintained the rooms were very nice. The hotel location was excellent. The atmosphere in the very important hotel bar was relaxing and  comfortable.                                             ,5
"I intermittently stay in Hotel de France as I occasionally work at the adjacent Lido Medical Centre for which it is very convenient. Although the entrance to the hotel is a bit utilitarian, the parking is always easy, the rooms are modern and well appointed, have always been clean, and the staff always freindly and very helpful.  Saffrons is an excellent Indian restauarant, the Cafe Aroma was a perfectly good hotel bistro, if not stunning, and breakfast was good.  The spa is very pleasant with a wide rane of pools/steam rooms, and a decent sized swimming pool for 'proper' swimming - although I would advise goggles as the chlorine level is quite high. The gym is well appointed and the 'ayurvedic' spa very interesting  Wifi coverage in the hotel is excellent and all free!  Would…",5
"Large, comfortable room.  Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Easy to book online.  Swimming pool is exquisite and relaxing and never too busy.  Comfortable seating in Reception area.  The best breakfast on the island.  I never stay anywhere else.",5
"Spent the weekend here; comfortable beds, very nice staff and were able to check in early which we appreciated having been up at 2am the previous day. nice facilities but unfortunately the weather was not favourable and we could not fully enjoy the outdoor areas. Would return again and recommend it to others               ",4
"My experience of the hotel was mixed. While I found the hotel less luxurious than expected, I found the hotel staff exemplary.  The room was dated and a little cheap looking. The heat was something else and there was no visible thermostat to turn it down. While there was tea and coffee making facilities, I would expect a hotel at this level to provide some herbal tea also. A big positive, however, was free wifi throughout the hotel.   I found the hotel to be vast. Far larger than I would normally pick. I loved the Ayush Spa - it was simply wonderful with great staff and a real addition to my stay.  The staff? I arrived in with a broken tooth and a car parked in the wrong place. Before booking me in, one Receptionist had made an appointment at a nearby dentist while another…",3
"This family run hotel is a delight.  Exceptionally well maintained, the common areas and guest rooms are warm and welcoming.  The staff throughout the hotel are helpful and friendly at all times.  The cuisine, from the exceptional breakfast, through to supper time is superb, and the wine list a pleasure.  There is a superb gym and indoor pool plus lovely gardens offering sunbeds for total relaxation.  There is a car park (rare in St Helier), and the location is perfect. A fifteen minute stroll to the town centre and marinas.  We had a great five days stay.",5
"When reading up on this hotel through Trip Advisor I was lead to believe that we were booking a luxury beak which wasn't the case. It is a nice hotel with a luxury spa but the hotel itself is dated. We had a very young baby with us and although they provided us with a very good sized room, a fridge and a high chair the hotel itself wasn't really geared up to cater for children. (They never claimed that they could so no critism, just stating a fact just in case you are traveling with children). The hotel is situated up a very steep hill and the town is about a 20 minute walk. The breakfast spead was great and the food in Cafe Aroma was excellent. We had booked in for a whole week and I discovered that they charge a corkage fee if you drink your own wine in your room - I get why…",3
"This is the best hotel I have stayed at in Jersey. I would definitely go back again and plan to do so very soon. The staff were very friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were large and exceptionally clean (as was every area of the hotel). The food and entertainment in the hotel was fantastic as were the facilities, pool, sauna etc. If you want to stay in a luxury hotel for a short break or family holiday this is the one to choose.",5
"The hotel is quite impressive looking, unfortunately the entrance isn't! Something horrid has been built in front of the facade of the hotel, sort of bunker, so only when you drive around this and into a car park, then have to drive up another level do you come to the entrance!  Our room was very small, a standard room. Bathroom was crazy, nowhere to put anything ( who designs bathrooms? there is never any hooks or shelving to put your stuff out).  We had a fantastic dinner, it was a huge 'anniversary do' that we had been invited to and to get that right took something.  Also the next mornings breakfast was definitely something to write home about. Room not so good, food great.",3
"My partner booked a weekend in Jersey for us to escape London for some rest and relaxation.  Check in was polite and efficient.  Our room (#272) was horrible.  Dark and dingy with dated decor.  A tiny window overlooking a glass roof covered in pigeon droppings and a grey wall of the building.  On a ledge above our window appeared to be where the pigeons nested and slept.  We had a meal booked for 8pm and did not finished until 1130pm - too long for a 7 course degustation.  Delay between 2nd and 3rd courses was 30+ mins.  Also long delays for the final course.  Staff were friendly, but there was not enough of them.  The food was superb, apart from slightly overcooked lobster.  Afterwards we went to reception to see what could be done about our room.  There were no upgrades or…",2
"The hotel is very well situated in St Helier for walking anywhere within the town and if you have a car (and there is ample parking) for the rest of the island too.   I couldn't really fault the hotel at all, other than our room on the fifth floor had an adjoining door and we could hear our neighbour talking on her phone very clearly.  Obviously any other noise from either side of the door *could* be an issue....  Other than that, the room was very clean (great view across the town and bay from the window)  Breakfast was fantastic, one of the best I have sampled outside of an all-inclusive resort and we ate one evening in the Café Aroma restaurant and it was very nice, with good service and reasonable prices.  The spa is great, again only a slight issue in that twice someone…",4
"Breakfasts were fabulous and ate in restaurant one night which was also tasty and reasonable price. Room was perfect, good shower.Hotel quiet generally . Not too far to walk down to town centre , about 15 mins.Spa area one of nicest Ive ever been in.",5
"This hotel is in a good location for all directions, very clean (although never saw any cleaners) we had an amazing stay for our 30th Anniversary, made extra special by the bubbly, flowers and fruit left in our room on our anniversary making that a little bit more special. ALL the staff we came across  were most welcoming and courteous, the food was good and plenty of choice. Spa was wonderful, and so clean and tidy , we had a most lovely 4 days and cant wait to return again. We had spa room-well worth paying a little extra for. Cant wait to go back again soon.",5
"A lovely hotel - the reception area is very grand, and the rooms very comfortable. The staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was well stocked with a good selection to choose from; as with similar buffets in other hotels, sadly buffet food is never hot, just warm - but a good start to the day, and enjoyable anyway. There was a good atmosphere at breakfast, and even when we ran a bit late one day - we did not feel rushed or pressured. We did not try the restaurant or spa facilities. Rooms were comfortable enough, and generally well looked after, although attention to some small details would just lift the rating a bit - such as the coating peeling off the bath handle; a chipped bath tub;  There was no soap, insufficient toilet roll and the shower cap was…",4
"Great trip away and good place to stay. Decided to bring my bike over and spend next day cycling, secure area for bike was available. Staff took bike away and secured it and lots of help given on reception about hotel and amenities. Was able to leave bag the next day and enjoy a days cycling. Only comment would be blinds let in light in morning so up with the larks but not a problem for me.",5
"We stayed overnight at the hotel de France it's the second time I have stayed and even more impressed we upgraded our room to a spa balcony room, it was clean well decorated and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bonus we felt like royalty. The spa is second to none. We had afternoon tea in cafe aroma out on the terrace and we dined in saffron which was lovely and we were fitted in as it was fully booked. Very impressed. The breakfast is out of this world with a huge variety. We didn't want to leave. When I previously stayed with the girls my husband couldn't understand it as we live in jersey but after our stay he admitted it was amazing. We will definitely stay again as soon as possible. Very friendly staff",5
"There's nothing wrong with HDF at all, it's clean, tidy, the staff are super friendly and the breakfasts are really very good (other than the coffee, we paid for the ""nice"" coffee as it was so bad!). It's nicely positioned to wonder into St Helier. One of our taxi drivers said, it's very corporate and you really don't get the feel of the island from the hotel and I think he's probably right. Don't get me wrong HDF is lovely and there really is nothing wrong there, a couple of tweaks and a few decorative changes and the place could get to 5 stars, but don't be put off. We also ate at Saffrons and the food and service were excellent. We tried the tasting menu with the wine and beer pairing and all three were lovely. I would certainly recommend the Hotel De France if you're after a…",4
"Four nights here for work. Everything very good indeed. Excellent room, excellent breakfast, excellent restaurants for lunchtime and evenings; I didn't bother going anywhere else to eat as there is a wide choice and everything I had was first-class. The swimming pool, jacuzzi, plunge pool were great additions that I hadn't expected but I used them before breakfast and after work.  A very good hotel with super staff.  Stayed April 2015, travelled on business",5
"We had to cancel last year and the hotel very kindly kept our booking for us until April this year.  we arrived a day late due to Aurigny canceling a flight (another story), food lovely service and staff great, very nice shame Aurigny had to spoil it for us so much when it had been long awaited for",5
"This hotel is 4 star, it should be a 5. The staff are amazing, polite and pleasant. The food is excellent, service is brilliant. The leisure facilities are a dream and the hotel is immaculate. I have now opted to go back. They offer a shuttle service to town, it is only a pleasant 15 minutes walk for those that like to stretch their legs. I could not fault the service or the staff.",5
Had an extra night in Jersey as our plane broke on take off and was grounded! Lovely Hotel reminds me of a French Chateau very grand with fantastic pool area and spa. Excellent food and service and for style in St Helier hard to beat. Would re visit.,5
My wife and I took a well-earned break from kids to Hotel de France. We'd booked through a third party website to get a better deal but after that I contacted them to arrange an upgrade Andy ubbly on arrival. The staff could not have been more helpful and when we arrived the room was perfect!  The best thing about this hotel though has to be the Ayush Spa - it's heavenly! We didn't eat at the hotel because we preferred to walk into the centre of St Helier (there's a free shuttle bus but it only takes 10mins).  All in all it was the perfect romantic escape. We will definitely go back...we just need to book the babysitters!,5
"We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay room lovely  food lovely staff lovely all round good value for money, I am glad we chose to upgrade our room the facilities were second to none and we enjoyed just looking around the hotel, the spa facilities wer amazing but. Forgot to take my swimming costume so was unable to  swim.",5
"So many positives with this hotel. The spa area was incredible, four separate pools each with its own function, plus a steam room and sauna. The sun loungers were so comfortable and the towels provided along with lockers and changing rooms. The breakfast was so filling and everything was on offer even right at the end of breakfast there was lots of choice. The hotel staff were friendly and helped with ordering taxis for us, and the shop is a nice touch. Being able to get a can of drink at 1 30 am is very useful. One regret would be that the room didn't have a little fridge, as the room kept rather warm even with the window open. The bed was magnificent however, and the bathroom was perfect for us. Enjoyed having sky sports on the TV! The fact that room service was available all…",5
"the standard room was a good size with well finished and maintained facilities, fresh decor. A very good standard. Breakfast was also a very good standard. Spa and restaurant was excellent and created a strong indoor bad weather option. Staff were friendly and looked after us very well indeed.",4
We have just returned from an Easter break at Hotel de France and had a great time. The hotel is well positioned and has plenty of parking so no issues with or without a car. The room was a really good size with a fab bathroom with walk in shower and separate huge bath tub. We had a spa room which is in the new wing I believe and was well furnished in terms of the quality and style of the items but it felt a little sparse. There was a 2 seater sofa and chair at a desk/dresser but apart from this there was just the bed and wardrobe and the room felt a little under furnished. There was plenty of room for a table and chairs for in room dining or a full size sofa and easy chair to relax in and watch the wall mounted tv making it into a great junior suite which would feel much more…,4
"Excellent hotel as always.  Staff are generally very good and helpful, the Spa is an absolute delight and the rooms with balcony are just great.  We have visited several times.  On this trip, the room cleaning was not up to scratch a couple of times and Cafe Aroma has become a bit 'samey', so we ate out 3 nights.  Otherwise, very good.",4
"Not a trendy or boutique hotel as such but uber stylish and very luxurious. It is a very, very big place but it still feels cosy, friendly and personal. Great views from the higher floors at the front of the hotel and the spa facility is first class.  Polite yet unobtrusive staff and sublime food. Would I stay again? O yes!",5
"Lovely stay, staff very accommodating😊 Brilliant spa facilities. Had dinner at Cafe Aroma very nice especially the dessert suggested by the lovely waitress... Also breakfast great only downside to it I couldn't eat anymore...",4
"Nothing bad to say about our stay. I would recommend this hotel and jersey.  It's so tranquil. We have a spacious room and a balcony with a beautiful view. We stayed in room 212 which I believe may have been the spa room.  The hotel staff were friendly. Upon we had a complimentary bottle of bubbly and some fresh fruit which was fabulous, I think they upgraded our room due to it being our minimoon.  My husband said it was the best hotel we've stayed in. The spa was beautiful and so relaxing. It's ins good location and a few minutes walk into St helier.  Breakfast was lovely. Choice of buffet breakfast and full English. The full English was massive and excellent quality. I couldn't eat it all. A typical full English contained 3/4 rashers bacon, two sausages, two eggs, mushrooms,…",4
"My wife and I have been to this hotel a number of times and we are never disappointed. Well laid out comfortable rooms with free Wi-Fi and a range of channels on the TV. The hotel is situated a bit out of town, say a 20 min walk if you do not have a car. But if you do not fancy that take advantage of the free minibus into town or the bus station. Café Aroma provides a good selection of food and reasonable prices and if you fancy splashing out try Saffrons but I would recommend booking. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Jersey and St Helier are very pleasant and and relaxing and there are lots of things to do",5
"The staff are very efficient and friendly. We have a room with a balcony and it's huge. The decor is lovely and the bathroom fab! I stay in hotels a lot and have a somewhat jaundiced attitude but I can honestly say, this is excellent.",5
"Beautiful hotel with incredibly friendly helpful staff, they couldn't do more for you! Very clean and efficiently run, we enjoyed the relaxing free spa facilities and breakfast offered a huge variety of well cooked fresh food. Make sure you check out the specials menu if you get bored of the buffet as the poached eggs and omelettes were delicious. They also provide a free bus into town at different times of day and offer pick ups too. Rooms are well equip with hairdryer,free wifi, tea/coffee etc and a lovely view. Our only critique would be the pillows which were like bricks in sheets : ( otherwise a truly pleasant stay!!",4
"Having spent our Honeymoon there 40 years ago this was a treat from our daughters and it was wonderful. The staff were so nice, the food in the restaurants was excellent. A nice touch were the flowers, fruit and champagne in our room on arrival to celebrate our Anniversary also the pink champagne and chocs at our evening meal in the Saffron restaurant very kindly provided by a lovely lady whose name we didn't get but had been at the Hotel for 28 years and was originally from Nottingham. The spa was superb I had a lovely treatment well worth a visit, the pool area was very inviting and spotless. Our room was clean and airy, tea and coffee well stocked every day. We had a fabulous few days thank you.",5
"The selection of really relaxing hotels out there is slim, so when you find one you should hold on to it and make friends with every one in it. Ive stayed at the hotel 10+ times but its been almost 5 years since i had the opportunity to stay here and what a welcome back it was, friendly stay more then happy to help with anything you could possibly need, Customer service makes this place, the hotel is amazing, great rooms great food and facilities 5star. This isn't just one more hotel, Book for a night stay for life, its a home from home",5
"Stayed for the 4th time at this hotel. It is an ideal base for anyone working on the island, nowhere is too far away if you have a hire car, I was working in St. Helier, which is just as easy to walk( 10 mins),or take courtesy bus and saves hassle of parking. I was also working at the quarry in St.John which is 6 miles or 15 min drive from hotel.The rooms are to a good standard with wifi throughout, restaurant serves standard pub fare to good standard, didn't try the restaurant on 1st floor. Spa nice and relaxing after a days work. Would definitely recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",4
Positives: Reception staff polite and available Possibly the best spa in Jersey Room clean  Drawbacks: Hotel restaurant fully booked and no other restaurant within walking distance Limited staff in the spa or at breakfast Room was basic and no robes - not great given it was a 'spa package',3
"lovely room with a view, just as we had asked for. We ate twice in cafe aroma and the food was very good and reasonably priced. Spa is excellent and pool nice and warm. Could not fault the staff who were friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back to De France.",5
"We have tried a couple of alternative hotels for our regular trips to Jersey but return to the Hotel De France as our favourite.  It is ideally situated a few minutes walk out of St Helier centre so a pleasant strol to the many restaurants the town has on offer, and also to our work.   The restaurant in the hotel is usually closed during our stays (Saffrons) Often Sunday and Monday so we opt to walk into town.   The spa and pool facilities are absolutely brilliant and well worth a daily visit.   Good wireless service and usually the rooms are quite spacious but during the winter period we have been accommodated in the main building rather than the wings where the rooms are a little cramped, particularly when the girlfriend has a suitcase full of boots that she chooses to leave…",5
"A very comfortable, welcoming hotel with excellent facilities, I enjoyed my stay. The rooms are spacious, beds good. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. It is a long way from the airport and so I needed taxis there and back",4

"wonderful mothers day weekend, spent in a warm friendly amazing hotel, would definitely recommend to others, child friendly, amazing food.  well worth a stay. Rooms are of a very high standard. cant wait to return.",5
"If you are looking for a Grand Hotel with a good Restaurant, a Spa & free parking, then this is possibly the best choice. However, the hotel is a good 10-15 mins walk into town. We chose the Spa room with Balcony to get a bigger room with a view of the city. Buffet breakfast was huge with great choice (Try the Jersey yogurts). Good place to use as a base to travel (by car) to visit the rest of the island. Yacht, Pomme D'or or Banjo's are more central or consider the one's in St Brelades Bay.  If you visit the island, make sure you visit Rozel Bay and especially to Plemont Bay.",4
"Great mid-week break with my partner! Sooo relaxing, the staff could not do enough for us! We ate at the restaurant and that was great too! The room had a lovely view of St Helier. But leaving the best till last... The Spa! The best we have ever visited!!!",5
"Spa rooms are always worth it! Clean, spacious room, lovely bathroom. Room service breakfast in bed is one of the best in Jersey (although you don't get sauces unless you request it), and the spa is perfect. Staff are always helpful and polite.",5
"The facilities and presentation of the hotel on first encounter are very impressive. The rooms are feel somewhat corporate but umftorable but it is best to get a room the faces the front of the hotel as the views at the back are slightly dssapointng, unless you like roofes. Breakfast and evening dining  facilities are rather special. Staff are always personable but professional. I highly recommend Hotel De France.",4
"A great Hotel upgraded to a spa room for £25 extra a night Fantastic spa facilities, and a great Indian Restaurant (Saffron) Food was a picture on a plate. Booked on a weekend deal flight and car hire included VERY GOOD value",4
"This hotel has a grand reception area but my room was disappointing in comparison with a small double and less space than a premier Inn.   The cafe restaurant had good junk food and the staff were nice enough.  The spa was amazing. Big pool, steam room and ice pool as well as lots of loungers.  The hotel is high on the hill about 15 minutes walk from the town.",4
"we started our day using the fantastic spa facilities, followed by some lunch on the terrace which was lovely and the staff were very friendly.  In the evening we went down to the bar for yummy cocktails and an amazing dinner in saffrons, which is by far the best Indian food in the island! We had a balcony room which had some amazing views of st helier.  All in all fab hotel, will definitely go back for all their facilities!",5
Hotel de France was a wonderful escape from London.  The Hotel was immaculate. The service was friendly and we really enjoyed the buffet breakfast. There are 3 or 4 restaurants inside the actual hotel in which all of them serve great food especially the one by the Spa.  The Spa itself was fantastic. One of the best I have been to. Location was also good not too far from St Helier and the main attractions.,5
"Absolutely superb stay. The staff are so friendly and keen to make your stay as wonderful as possible. The entire hotel is clean and spacious. The spa is the best on island without doubt. We opted to pay £25 more and get a spa room, which is worth the small difference in price. The beds are so comfy, the food delicious... I could go on and on. I wouldn't stay anywhere else on island. We loved it. :)",5
If you are going on holiday or business only stay in this hotel 20 years I have been going to Jersey working 3 vists a year never have I been disappointed. My other sale managers have used simller 4 star greatly disappointed. DON'T MAKE SAME MISTAKES. 20 years of using this hotel every time has never let me or my family down 10/10 keep the good work.  BRAND MANAGER POLICE.,5
"I booked a trip to jersey so I could propose to my partner, Hotel de France proved to be the perfect choice in accomodation, the hotel is beautiful and our room was faultless, great being able to enjoy the sunset from the balcony, breakfast was amazing and a great choice available, customer service was above an beyond, Will be the only place I will book when we return to jersey, thank you Hotel de France,",5
"We have stayed before , and again the staff and hotel are excellent . The spa facilities are fantastic and being able to have the late check out option was such a help. We would highly recommend this hotel .",5
"I visited the hotel on a business trip, travelling alone. The staff are welcoming friendly and accommodating. I got breakfast to go one day when I was out early and anything I asked they were able to accommodate me. The spa is peaceful and relaxing and having a gym on site is great when travelling for work. I stayed in a twin room at the front of the hotel with a view across the city which was fabulous. The room had everything I needed and was comfortable. Both the restaurants serve delicious food and breakfast was fresh with lots of choices. Would definitely recommend the hotel and would happily return.",5
"Great hotel! Stayed here on business with a colleague. Beautiful grounds and design of hotel, with two lovely restaurants. Breakfast was amazing! The rooms were nice but averagely decorated could have a slight revamp with rooms however other than that perfect! ",4
"We came on a two night break. Hotel was very welcoming and the staff at the reception were excellent, nothing was to much trouble. A special mention  to anyone wanted to eat in saffrons restaurant. This was the most amazing fusion food I have tasted.  The monkfish was  the best.  I would recommend this hotel. We stayed in room 202 and was  large with amazing views.  Can't wait to go back again.",5
"Used a JT Insight voucher for a night's stay with breakfast and couldn't fault it. Took advantage of the beautiful indoor pool and jacuzzi, and lazed around there till dinner. The Saffrons restaurant was fully booked so we ate in the Café Aroma which was great and very reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant, whereas the Saffrons menu looked a tad expensive. Our room didn't have a great view, it was at the back of the hotel overlooking a large corrugated roof, but so what it was dark when we went to bed and we were given the opportunity to upgrade at extra cost at the time of booking. Breakfast is served in the Orangery and was excellent, a better quality and selection than your standard hotel fare. The Jersey yoghurt was especially good, and the coffee much better than…",5
"We stayed in a Spa room with a lovely views of St Helier,Elizabeth Castle and St Aubins Bay in the distance.  The staff were helpful and efficient. Saffron's Fusion  restaurant is wonderful- a  real surprise. The Spa and pool are beautiful. We will visit again.",4
"I had a couple of issues during my stay, nothing to do with the hotel but they were very accommodating & changed my room.  Food is excellent in cafe Aroma & reasonably priced. All staff were very friendly & the spa is lovely. very nice to relax in after a long day.  would definitely recommend it.",5
"Try it for yourself this was my tenth stay and each time it achieves the same high standards Needed to hirer a car the receptionist just kept trying till she got the best price Me and my wife tried both restaurants one was a type of steak bar which we both sampled the steak and hers being medium and mine rare were cooked to perfection The second restaurant was Asian and as Nicola put it "" that was one of the best meals I have ever eaten"" which says it all ",5
"Stayed for 2 nights with children in inter connecting room. Excellent service, best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel, with and option to eat a bit of everything! highly recommend the spa, we had no treatments but the whole family enjoyed the pool area. Fantastic place to stay would certainly return.",5
"Positives: The breakfast was really good. Great choice!  Negatives: The bathroom was ancient. Everything was really old, but functioning. I had seen better 3 star hotels. The walls were as thin as paper and I could hear every conversation (and more) from the neighbours. I hardly slept in the 2 nights at the hotel. The cleaning staff was careless. The bins were not emptied and bathroom toiletries and coffee/tea were not replenished. This could be expected of a 4 star hotel!",2
I am local to Jersey but it is always nice to have a weekend break. I have stayed 3 times now and everything has always been fantastic. Definitely want to go back again and again.  The spa is fantastic and the food is lovely. Staff are always helpful and the spa rooms are stunning. Can't wait to stay again. ,5
"Having stayed at the hotel 35 years ago for our '3 day honeymoon'  we wanted to come back and celebrate.  The hotel was fantastic and made our stay memorable, enjoyable and all that an anniversary should be. The spa and pool  facilities were excellent and contributed to a relaxing and refreshing few days. Food excellent and the service was promt and very professional.",5
"The staff in the hotel were very friendly and the room in the new wing was very well appointed and spacious with a great view over St Hellier. A very good breakfast was provided as part of the package.   The new swimming pool and spa are lovely - lots of space, warm water and very comfortable loungers.  Food in the Saffrons restaurant was very good, and for those who do not like a lot of spice, there is a non-spicy menu.",4
"Excellent, efficient, large hotel with very friendly staff. Very good value for money. We reserved 3 rooms and all were clean and modern, two of them having sweeping views over St Helier and the sea. The hotel is in a good location on a gentle hill at the back of town and is very well equipped with 2 restaurants, separate large breakfast room, bar, hairdresser and indoor pool/spa. Plenty of parking both covered and uncovered. Wifi throughout (worked everywhere) what is a large building.  The staff were always smiling and were especially friendly and helpful. Everything ran so smoothly. A perfect family break. We will definitely return.",5
"Beautiful, romantic, friendly staff, tasty food. Rate between price and service is very good. Room is with old style but still looks good and comfortable. Pool that is great. I especially recommend view from room.",5
In the past 10 years I have had many occasions to work in Jersey. I have been to many hotels on the island but always hope for a booking Hotel de France. From reception to bar person to maids the whole team seems to be friendly and helpful. I really enjoy a quite tipple in the bar after dinner relaxed atmosphere to read a book.,5
The dining experience at Saffrons on 13 and 14 February was exceptional.. The tasting menu was innovative and perfectly prepared cookedand presented.. The ALaCarte was also excellent and similarly very enjoyable... Every credit to the Team....,4
I've stayed  with yourself  a few  times and it's Ben fantastic.i was really looking  forward  to dinner in cafe aroma and it seems to of changed hands the menu and food wasn't as good as it used to be and service was slow apart from that  me and my partner had a great  time I hope it will improve  as it won't stop me returning ps.  Add club sandwich  back on the  menu :) ,4
"I decided to take my partner here for Valentines day as they offered an amazing package which included a 7 course taster menu in Saffrons. I decided to opt for an upgraded room above the Spa and I would definitely recommend it. The room was very spacious and had a lovely view with a balcony looking into St.Helier. The Saffrons restaurant was outstanding, very high level service and unbelievably amazing food! They accommodated to my partners allergy's very well and were more than happy to change the taster menu to suite this. We opted for the wine with each course and it was definitely the right choice, very fitting. Our stay was made even more pleasurable by a waiter called ""Laurent"" (spelling may be incorrect) who ensured we were well ""topped up"" and everything was to our…",5
"Had a lovely stay for one night. Used the gorgeous spa all afternoon.   Only negative: Wasn't allowed to gym in Health Haus but had to go to the hotel guest gym which was an old conference room with the old gym equipment in! This was fine for me but wasn't much of a gym.  Room, breakfast, service, cleanliness all fantastic.",4
"We stayed at the Hotel de France this weekend to celebrate my Husbands 50th Birthday and we had a very enjoyable stay. The food was delicious, the pool was lovely and the view from the hotel was perfect. A must see hotel and suitable for all special occasions.",5
"Beautiful spa, fantastic breakfast (both included), clean, comfortable room with a lovely view over St Helier. The staff were friendly and efficient, the laundry service was superb, and the food in Cafe Aroma was delicious. I especially recommend the desserts.",5
"I stayed at the De France on a business trip and it turned an otherwise mundane trip into a very pleasant visit. The service is impeccable without being overbearing and despite being a big hotel there isn't a hint of stuffiness about it.  I stayed in one of the larger rooms at the Spa end of the hotel and would probably pay the extra to upgrade again, it's worth it for the bathroom alone.  Its location means it's an easy walk into St Helier, but there is also ample parking which is a rarity for a hotel so close to town (in my experience).  There don't seem to be any needs that the hotel doesn't cater for, it has certainly become a new favourite of mine.",5
"As ever, the room was fresh, modern and spotlessly clean. Great pool, nice basic gym and the jewel in the crown as ever was the quality of the food which is part of the reason I always choose to stay here when I come to Jersey on business. I've been staying here regularly since 2005 and have always had a top quality experience. ",5
"we had a lovely time here : we booked via secret escapes a good all inclusive deal and upgraded to a spa room for an extra £25 a night, so the overall deal was cheap for the standard of hotel. highlights were the very high quality spa, and the good friendly service, especially from the head waiter who was exceptional in his care. the small grill restaurant served very good quality steaks at a reasonabke price. The slight caveats relate to the room, which had lovely picture windows, and was very spacious, but was let down by the lack of a couch/sofa: the room was huge so I am not sure why there was no comfy seats to relax in and admire the view: the room looks very bare.  secondly the temperature! The room was VERY hot at night and the conditioning did not seem to control it.:…",4
Stayed at this hotel whilst in Jersey on business and found both the hotel and the staff first class.  Very comfortable room in beautiful hotel and the food is delicious.  Nothing was a problem for the staff and as I will be back at the end of the month for another stay I look forward to it and hopefully will find the time to enjoy all the extra facilities this hotel has to offer.,5
"Really enjoyed our over night stay in this hotel. The staff were excellent, the room was very comfortable and the food was lovely. We spent a few hours in the Spa which was very relaxing. Ample parking and a 15 min walk down to the town.  Just a 'Superb' hotel !",5
"There is nothing I found negative about this hotel, from the service when I called reservations to the morning we left. I it was just perfect. I live in Jersey and this particular weekend had just moved house and was just exhausted and needed a relaxing couple of days to recover . What a find, of course I knew Hotel de France existed but had only ever visited for functions. The SPA was just what was needed, swimming, sauna, steam room,  massage and the food and  in the restaurant Aromas was amazing. The special on the first night we arrived was beef stroganoff, I asked if it had sweet peppers as I am alergic, the response was yes it had peppers but the chef will cook you one without peppers, now that is what I call service, I really wanted the stroganoff and it was delicious! …",5
"On the recommendation of a local colleague, we booked to stay here and were delighted with everything.  Very cosy comfortable room...certainly not at all chilly even though we were staying in January.  We were made very welcome by staff who regularly greeted us as we passed in the spacious passageways.  Delicious breakfast buffet and excellent Lounge Bar which was open on one of the nights of our stay.  The Aroma Restaurant also provided a lovely meal for us on our first night.",5
Great facility's and great staff! This hotel is in a great location in the heart of st helier but away from the road so very quiet! I would recommend staying here if you like the night life and if you like a bit of peace and quiet to relax and enjoy the facilities the hotel has to offer,4
"We went for a spa day which was amazing but when we checked into our room which felt empty and the decor wasn't all that. Dinner was at 7pm and the staff were lovely however, I ordered goats cheese with red onion chutney and it tasted like it had been in the fridge for days and has just been taken straight out and put in front of me! My partners starter was hard Paa ham and they only received one slice. The main was ok (lamb) but the dessert was awful (tiramisu). ",2
this is a top place with kind and lovely staff!! Everything perfect.  Best breakfast ever and gorgeous spa facilities.  Nothing was too much trouble and we were very comfortable for the whole time we were there x,5
"Treating friends for a special birthday is not always easy so with a little trepidation we decided on a weekend in Jersey!! Picked the flights then the Hotel and could not have booked a friendlier place to stay. From the Reception, driver of courtesy bus to Town, man with the towels & slippers at the Spa, Sauna & Pools, Bar staff & Breakfast team nothing was too much. Only reservation was it was further from the main drag of Town than we realised.",5
Me and my boyfriend had a lovely stay at your hotel. The service was excellent and the staff made us feel very welcome and were very friendly. The rooms were clean and the spa was exquisite. We would definitely stay here again ,5
"second stay at this hotel, the room on the first visit was excellent on this occasion we were in a smaller room which was small and felt like it could benefit from modernising, the hotel services were excellent and the staff were as helpful as they could be, overall a great hotel for a short break but i would insist on a better room",4
"This is the third time my wife and I have had an overnight stay at the Hotel de France, as with the others, we couldn't really fault anything.  The welcome is warm and genuine, the rooms have all been clean and well appointed (we thought the best room so far was 256).  The Spa is an excellent way to wind down in the afternoon with a book/paper/magazine.  We've eaten at Saffron's once, and Cafe Aroma twice - both excellent - don't feel you get any less quality at the Cafe - the food is lovely and not over-priced for a hotel.  We'll be back before the end of March for another escape, and suspect it will continue to feature on our list of places to get away from things for 24/36 hours.",5
"I have stayed at the Hotel De France on numberous times over the past year and each time I go back it feels like coming home. The Hotel has a much nicer feel than some of the larger group hotels and the staff are all helpful and delightful.  The spa is excellent too.  I would have no hesitation in recommending it for either business or pleasure and whilst the rooms may not be the very newest, the beds are comfortable, clean and tidy.   And... don't miss the opportunity to dine in the excellent Saffron's restaurant which is superb.  Finally, the Wi-Fi has to be about the best i have ever experienced, good coverage throughout and in every room i have stayed in and pretty good speeds too..All included.",4
"Stayed for 5 nights had a fab time visiting my son. The Spa was fantastic and the treatments top class, plenty of healthy food and drink in the hotel bar. Single female but felt happy going to the bar and restaurant and spa on by myself.  Would definitely stay again.",4
As usual another pleasant stay thanks to the friendly staff. The bar is nicely stocked and the staff were very friendly and attentive.Although they could do with some more draft beers. The breakfast is very good. The leisure facilities are also rather good.,4
Iv stayed in many hotels in top destinations in the world . & iv got to say for its price room balcony food staff porter  health spa & restaurant for me even though it was January its proberbly the best so far couldn't fault it .so impressed was my 10 year old daughter as well we have booked to go back in February for the weekend . ,5
"My husand and I honeymooned in Jersey in August 2014 and therefore looked for somewhere a little more special to stay considering it was for our honeymoon. As soon as we walked through the hotel doors we knew we had found a lovely place - the hotel is very spacious and clean and the reception staff extremely warm, friendly and helpful. In fact, we would say that of all of the staff we encountered during our 11 night stay.  Breakfast is in the form of a buffet and is plentiful and of good quality - you can choose anything from a cooked breakfast to continental, cereals, fruit, yoghurt - the choice is vast and varied and you can eat as little or as much as you like. We ate dinner a couple of times in Cafe Aroma which offered big portions and good quality food. We spent a few…",4
"The Hotel De France, is a hotel my wife and Ihave visited many times. The  Spa and pool, built   after a fire several years ago are as good as any 5 star hotel. However, unless you book a Spa room, some of the other rooms in the main part of the hotel are dated, and the rooms at the back of the hotel have very poor views. Apart from this, service, meals and the atmosphere of the hotel are all first class. In particular Saffrons Indian resteraunt  is superb and is highly recommended. We wiill go back this year, booking a Spa room!",4
Stayed two nights in a well appointed room...lots of space..loved the jacuzzi bath..perfect place for a weekend away..extensive choice on the room service menu..staff very helpful and polite and attentive..breakfast was lovely and made fresh to order,5
"We had a one night stay to try and get a good nights sleep (whilst Grandparents looked after the Children!). When we arrived the staff pre-warned us of an event in the Hotel that might be noisy and if we had any problems we could let them know They were right and we eventually went to ask for another room (we aren't the best of complainers!). We were moved into another room which was much better I only wish we had said something earlier as it was a bit of a hassle However I give the Hotel facilities and staff (and Food) a Top rating, highly recommended and when if you experience a problem the staff are quick to put things right - well done",5
An excellent Hotel. Staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms are very comfortable. This Hotel has an 'old world' charm combined with modern facilities such as wi-fi and free parking. Recommended.,5
"I stayed in Hotel de France for the first time around ten years ago. The reason why I choose to stay in this hotel again every time I visit Jersey because as its name implies from outlook to interior all the decor are in French style. The exterior is typical French architecture combine with relax atmosphere, this is a hotel you must stay when one visit Jersey. Highly recommend!!!",5
"I enjoyed my stay at the HOtel de France, the staff are very friendly and the rooms are clean. The pool is pretty impressive and a great way to start youe day in Jersey. The restaurant outside is a good place to relax in the evening....................",4
The service from beginning to end was lovely and the food was stunning! The spa facilities were very tranquil and idyllic but treatments were rather pricey. The room itself was spacious and well laid out and the facilities were very clean and modern with options and under floor heating!,5
"Stayed here before out of season and just wonder if it's a different place in the summer. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is good, the room is always clean and tidy. The spa is amazing and worth staying here for alone. The gym is a bit small and dated compared to the size of the pool etc. but it does the job well. The big problem I have with this place is the grumpy staff! Both staff when I checked in and out made me feel I should have taken my money somewhere else as they really couldn't care less. The breakfast was OK, but the staff there were trying to take my plate away as I was still eating! I have to say the guy in the bar was very helpful and good at his job, can't say that for the others! All in all it's a great place, but just be expecting a very warm welcome!",4
"This is by far the best spa in jersey. Fabulous treatments. Lovely relaxation room. I've never been disappointed.   The pool is a good size, and the facilities pool side good - sauna, steam, hot and cold dips ! Because the pool area is larger than most spas there are plenty of loungers to choose from.  Stayed overnight, upgraded from the standard double room so had a larger bed and a bigger room. The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom very clean. The only downside is the room decor is dated and the furniture slightly dull ! The room just lacks personality.   We ate in saffrons. It isn't the cheapest restaurant but the food is certainly something you wouldn't taste anywhere else in jersey. So was worth it. The staff in the restaurant were very accommodating.  …",4
"Once upon a time this would have been a marvelous hotel. Our room still had signs of previous opulence. Time however, has not been kind to this hotel. Our room had been touched up where it needed it but this old beauty deserves much better than it has been given. Our room was comfortable but dated, no modern technology or bathroom amenities. The room was tidy but due to the touch ups it has been given over time seemed dirty, almost grimy. Sad. The reception staff were always helpful and pleasant. The dining room staff were not. The dining staff took forever to present themselves to the desk to seat us, where we were left for the entire remainder of our breakfast without an offer for tea, coffee or drinks. Not once did anyone check on us. Pathetic. This Hotel could be so much…",2
"This hotel was booked for me as a suprise for my birthday, on reading other trip advisors comments I decided to upgrade our room to a Spa room. Normally check in is 2pm but we were lucky enough to be able to check into our room at 9.30am (Probably due to it being out of season). I didnt see what the standard double was like, but I'm glad that we upgraded as our room was very comfortable & spacious. we had 2 lovely leather arm chairs in the room. The staff were very friendly and attentive but there were some lanuage barrier problems at times. The breakfast was delicious and the choice was immense. If I ever return to Jersery i would stay here again.",4
"Just had an excellent 3 night stay there, and cannot fault it, staff excellent, nothing too much trouble, breakfast is a feast and the Café Aroma has a very tasty menu. All in all I would recommend a stay there.",5
"We have stayed here on several occasions.  If not excellent everywhere, pretty good in almost all departments and good value.  Food at Saffrons Restaurant deserves a Michelin star and very acceptable elsewhere in the hotel.  Not centrally located in St Helier but courtesy bus available.",4
"I always use the Hotel when in Jersey, great pool, clean rooms, Indian restaurant has incredible food. Great location, friendly staff, great gym and leisure facility's. In the summer the terrace is a fantastic place to sit out and eat and relax.",5
"I have stayed here on several occasions. The rooms are comfortable and the staff helpful; breakfast excellent. However, the hotel is not centrally located for exploring St. Helier. Nevertheless good value.",4
"This is a stunning hotel, really enjoyed my stay here. Its such a big hotel, we stayed on the 4th floor and had no complaints...they really treat you well. We ate in the restaurant one night which was fantastic food and used the bar most evenings too and they were always so welcoming and friendly. there was a TV room (which suited my football loving colleagues!) And the also have a swimming pool and sauna which unfortunately we didn't get time to use due to our working hours, would have been good if the pool was open later in the evenings. The breakfast was generally good although I was disappointed my boiled eggs weren't runny the day I ordered them but you cant always have it all! Overall there was a great selection at breakfast and the one day we were up early the room…",5
"We booked this as a last minute deal for the bank holiday weekend at the end of August. The view from our room wasn't great (it was of some giant pipe thing at the back of the hotel) but we booked it really last minute and it was a good rate so you get what you pay for so we can't grumble.   The room itself was lovely. Very clean and very comfortable. The staff clearly take great care when attending rooms which makes all the difference.   The pool is amazing,  the steam room was lovely as was the sauna. We didn't get to use the spa as it was fully booked at the times we wanted so it's well worth booking treatments in advance.   We also ate in the hotel restaurant twice and the food/service were really good. A few more veggie options would have been good though.   The staff are…",5
As always the staff were attentive without being intrusive; we had a lovely spa suite which was spacious and had views over St Helier.  The spa is great although it was busier than usual and the food was good.  An ample breakfast helped finish off the overnight stay!  Thanks to all,5
"A wonderful hotel which we have stayed in many times before and will continue to whenever we visit jersey. Good rooms, lovely food, fantastic spa, stunning view of st helier from the hotel and our room.",5
Our business partners went as a group for two days and one night. Excellent room and facilities for our 'planning' weekend.  The spa rooms were large and well appointed. The golden room for our meals was charming and overall the quality of food wine and service were exemplary. Particular mention to John and his colleagues who helped out with our wine tasting on Saturday evening and for the chap organising us during the day. The spa was lovely but the gym needs updating as it is a little old and tired but serviceable.,5
We stayed in an interconnecting family room for one night.  Good sized rooms with high ceilings although the decor for a 4 star hotel (en suites) was a little dated.  The interconnecting room for the children was unfortunately next to the lift shaft but the noise (if any during the night) did not seem to bother them at all.  All service throughout the hotel was very friendly and efficient especially at Reception.  Good parking and feeling of space everywhere.  Not particularly geared towards children but made to feel very welcome anyway.  The spa is a great asset to the hotel and would definitely return again for this alone - quite an escape from the norm!,4
"This three night spa break was a birthday present for my two daughters and had been eagerly awaited. From the time of our arrival we knew we would not be disappointed. There was a slight hiccup when the girls' twin room I had booked turned out to be a double but housekeeping rectified this within minutes. Both rooms were spacious and I was very pleased with the size of my single. After some excellent and reasonably priced cocktails we dined at Saffrons where we sampled the most amazing fine dining-Indian style! The food and service were absolutely top notch. This same good service was found in all areas of the hotel and the breakfasts were of a very high standard too. We dedicated a whole day to relaxing and being pampered in the spa, the highlight being our Ayurvedic treatments…",5
"Fab hotel and spa facilities. Had dinner in Saffrons which was superb. The staff are brilliant, very helpful indeed. The room was nice, with a double bed but it felt a bit on the small side for a week of working away. We were on the 4th floor facing the town, which was quite noisy but only because of the very windy conditions.",5
"The second time I have stayed here on business, this time for a much longer period.  The facilities are excellent, my standard double room modern, a good size with all amenities/  Staff were efficient and very friendly, with nothing too much trouble  Breakfast very good, and I had an amazing dinner at the Saffron restaurant.  The hotel is 2 minutes by car or a brisk 15 min walk from the town centre, and also there is a regular shuttle bus in to town.  Have already booked my next two stays as I feel that this hotel gives the best value for money in St Helier for pleasure or business.",5
"Our diary:-  Ample parking, a very warm welcome from lovely staff. Our standard room was a bit of a disappointment based on how grand the hotel is. 10 min walked to town centre but worth paying £5 back due to uphill walk to the hotel. Saffron restaurant a must! Do not miss the chance to eat in this high end Indian restaurant. The bar was comfortable with excellent service and lots of choice. Breakfast, good choice of foods both hot and cold, with excellent service. The spa; wow wow wow... relaxation heaven. Treatments to die for and again excellent service. Treatments were different from the run of the mill spa so worth indulging yourself. Afternoon tea was a delight, not too heavy and very fresh.  Our conclusion:- this would be the only hotel we would stay at in St Helier. The…",4
This is an excellent 4 star establishment which delivers in all areas. An imposing Victorian hotel which has been constantly updated and immaculately maintained.  It has the finest spa and indoor pool on the island. The guest rooms are excellent and very well furnished. Flat TV's and personal safes are standard. The staff throughout are professional and attentive.  The breakfast is exceptional. The cocktail bar is beautifully furnished. There is all day dining to an excellent standard in the Aroma brasserie plus there is an exceptional gourmet Indian restaurant.  Another plus is the excellent parking facilities - so rare in St Helier. The hotel is pleasantly located a comfortable 20 minute stroll from the towns centre and Quay. We really enjoyed our stay and will return.,5
"I stayed for one night in a single room for £60 which was a bargain when I seen upon arrival.  The breakfast was exceptional with all the usual pickings, the staff throughout the hotel were always helpful, although its not in the city centre it makes it a nice 5 minutes walk into town.  The spa and gym facilities were amazing and all modernised to a high spec finish.  Pay the extra as you will not be disappointed!",5
Stayed here for 2 nights. On bed  only basis so unable to comment on breakfast or dinner however we did have a snack in the cafe by the spa which was very good.  Spent a day in the Spa which is excellent.  Nice and large so private space for everyone.  Treatments available if you want them.  Girls on reception very helpful.  We could hear the people next door having a conversation  through an adjoining door so our room needed soundproofing.  Ask for a room without adjoining door if you book.  Luckily for us the couple weren't over noisy but they could of been.,4
"The Hotel De France is fantastic. I work away a lot, and the Hotel De France is about the only one I look forward to arriving at. They have the BEST staff ever. On this visit I had trouble locating the hotel on my satnav, so one of the guys on the desk drove down to the ferry in his own car and I followed him back to the hotel! How good is that? Good, old fashioned service-and it feels like they really mean it. In the past they have shown me great restaurants, helped with my navigation around the island etc. always with a smile. Rooms nice too, Cafe Aroma has great staff as well. Looking forward to my next visit!!  10/10 easily!",5
"Great hotel, great people running it. The staff are ambassadors for the industry. Always polite, discrete, attentive. All in all great experience.I would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to others. We are both, my good lady and me,looking forward to finding a reason to go again! ",5
"Lovely room, super comfortable, quality bedding.  Absolutely delightful staff, nothing too much trouble. Café Aroma food was quite impressive. Breakfast equally so. Beautiful indoor infinity pools, so relaxing. This hotel is excellent and our 5 days stay felt like 10.  Enjoyed some very nice costly 5 star hotels in past and De France and it's staff leave many in their tracks. We will absolutely be returning,  it was delightful.",5
"The positives: amazing pool and spa. Jacuzzi could be a tad warmer. Hamam is perfect. Service really good at all levels and parts if the hotel. Food is also really nice. Saffron is excellent I had a perfect steak and the best lamb I have ever tasted the chef is amazing with spice but I would not label the restaurant "" Indian"" or even ""fusion"" it is classic but spicey! My only negative is that the rooms are a bit dated ",4
"We had a very relaxing break at Hotel de France, the rooms were clean, the facilities were good and the staff could't have been more helpful, the breakfast was very nice and lots to choose from.  Cabs from the air port start around £20, just out side the airport is a bus which gose stright to the main town.  When looking at places to eat look for tennerfest, which works out £10 for a meal which is a great value for money.",4
If you want a nice quiet break with some fine dining this is place to go. Saffrons restaurant was out of this world. Aromas was also very good. Rooms good & very clean. Our view was lovely too. Beds very comfortable. Staff very pleasant. The spa was one of the best I have visited and treatment of hot stones was worth every penny. Would definitely go back.,5
"Have stayed many times and this is the best hotel on Jersey, perhaps not the flashiest but quality of room and staff should not be underestimated.  The spa is truly amazing, comfortable, clean rooms, fab breakfast, I do not have any complaints.  It's in a great location to walk into the centre of St Hellier in 10 mins without the noise and parking issues of the Hotels in town or on the front.  You will not be disappointed.",5
"Stayed at the de France for three nights. My third time at this hotel. Spa and keep fit facilities are excellent. Room was very good. ALL hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Will stay there again if/when I go back. Unfortunately, Jersey, as a whole, has become too commercialised with many of the places to visit now being overpriced.",4
"Fantastic experience, friendly professional staff, superb food & facilities. Generally it's a hotel that has it all we stay here twice a year and every experience has been excellent.  Our favorite things about the hotel are the spa facilities and there A la Carte Restuarant although we're not really gym people the Gym looks amazing. We will continue to visit this hotel for many years as we have happy memories. The town is only 10 minutes walk if you fancy a wonder of to try some of the other fab Restaurants we have in Jersey.  ",4
"This hotel has everything you could wish for. Very impressed. A beautiful experience in an Island gem. The meal at Saffrons could not be faulted and if you want relaxation and peace, look no further. Will definitely be back.",5
"This really is a hotel of real contradictions.  Firstly, the disappointments. Whilst the room (executive) is large, frankly it is bland and disappointing. All dark brown wood and georgian-style furniture. Really could do with bringing up-to-date. Public areas suffer the same.  Also disappointing that, unlike most other hotels, once booked you are then committed to paying for a full night's accommodation even if you change your mind (although this wasn't eventually an issue for me).  But there are also some very real positives too. The spa is very good with a spacious pool layout, lots of loungers, sauna/steam room, etc. Very relaxing.  What's more, the Indian restaurant (Saffron) really is top drawer - excellent food served by some exceptional staff (Maitre D' deserves special…",4
"I visited this hotel for a 4 night midweek break at the beginning of October. My elderly parents were in a beautiful spa room, and with my Father in a wheelchair it was perfect as it had lots of space and also grab rails. A shower seat was even provided by management, so feel a lot of care was taken with our booking.  I stayed with my sister in a standard twin room which was fine, albeit there wasn't  that much space, but that didn't worry us, we had everything we needed and a view over town towards the sea which was lovely.  We used the spa every day which was so relaxing and stunning. I often ordered a juice or 2, felt like we were truly on holiday as the rain came down outside! I would recommend getting a treatment, I had a hot stone massage and the service from start to…",5
"What an amazing hotel.  We stayed in the height of summer with the weather lovely and although we were only in a standard double room it was a lovely size and we were lucky to have air con in the room however with the windows open it created enough breeze through the room was a nice touch to have it there tho.  Laurence who looked after us nearly every day at breakfast and dinner was superb, he knew such a lot about the menu and even told us how to make the strawberry and banna smoothy which I must say is a must try it was to die for :)  All the staff were brilliant and all very friendly.  Chambermaids we also brilliant my other half had a nose bleed and they changed the whole bedding.  Im sure we will be back some time in the future",5
Wonderful hotel but killer hill to get to door if walking from town. Breakfast staff looked as though they would love to be anywhere else but serving us paying customers. First time to Jersey and had a good week. ,4
"Our twin executive room was more like a suite with a generous sitting area, a separate dressing room and a large bathroom (which mercifully didn't have a noisy extractor fan). We felt the Saffrons restaurant was a little over the top but found the cafe a more informal place to eat and more reasonably priced. The hotel is only a short walk from the town centre but we wished that the receptionist had thought to give us the free map of the island on arrival instead of on our last day. It's a shame that the approach to this fine old building has been spoiled by a large, modern medical centre.",4
Room was clean but amenities were poor-one shamoo and shower gel. Heating all timed-I froze before it came on! Atmosphere was non existant. Breakfast made me horrendously sick-had to run out of orangery back to the room. Felt sick rest of weekend.  My sister subsequently was also ill. 😕 Mentioned it at reception  but no apparent action taken! Will not return in s hurry.,2
"I attended an awards function in the Corbiere Room which was a fabulous venue for the event although a little warm.   The staff were friendly and helpful, the food, facilities and service were all excellent.",5
"Great hotel just 10 minutes walk to centre of St. Helier.  We have just stayed for a few days break and the hotel was great, lots to do with the pool and spa.  Breakfast was everything you would need, good selection on offer.  We tried the restaurant Saffron, if you have the chance you should go.  Food is amazing and service is second to none.  Hotel staff are very helpful.  The hotel is big but you will not get lost, I do agree with another comment the hotel was hot, we had to turn the radiator off in both our room and bathroom (I am a hot person) may not be an issue for someone who is cold, we left the windows open, they were big windows facing front of hotel and we found this fine.  There was no traffic noise even with the windows open. You are set up high and there are a few…",5
"I attended a function, which was excellent. Being a local resident I decided to stay over night and was offered a special b and b rate. The room was very basic and a very small single. It was also very hot! I could not sit in the chair to use dressing table, as there was not enough room due to the bed. The bin had not been emptied from the previous guest. No full length mirror and poor lighting when getting ready for function. Could have done with a dressing gown/robe. Had room service breakfast and was given wrong items and hot food and drinks cold.",2
"I stayed at the De France for 4 nights and can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The Spa is superb and can recommend the steam room, I went down for a quick swim before dinner and ended up staying there for 2 hours every night. The WiFi was free with a fast internet connection, there were plenty of TV channels including Sky Sports. Breakfast was very good and lots of choices on offer and the restaurants were good value but the bar was pretty pricey - I have paid less in London The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay again.",5
Hotel rooms and hotel in general very hot. The room I was in was on the 5th floor and up until 9pm you could hear the fans on the roof vibrating heavily. The room service menu was limited and after a couple of nights I was thinking of buying food in!,3
"My sister and I both received Spa vouchers from family for our baby showers so we decided to make a weekend of it and book in overnight.  The room was lovely, nothing overly special but fine for a single night stay.  The Spa experience was stunning.  I had the reflexology massage and I was so relaxed I completely zoned out.  The other spa facilities (pools etc) were really nice and we felt very comfortable.  We didn't use any of the restaurants whilst we were there but ordered room service for our evening meal.  The price was quite reasonable and we were both sufficiently stuffed! My only complaint about the weekend was the breakfast.  We decided to pay the extra £2.50 to have breakfast delivered to our room and it was abismal.  The order was wrong so we both had mushrooms all…",3
"We spent 3 nights at the Hotel D'France.  It was comfortable, quiet and very relaxing.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The spa is lovely and the food excellent.  Would stay again.  We have been to Jersey many times to visit family, but decided to stay at a hotel this time, and the Hotel De France was a great choice.",5
"Only a 1 night stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable, plenty of hot water for a shower.  It's a 4* hotel with 4* quality and service.  Price wise in the bar it is comparable to that of a Central London hotel, so be prepared for a little shock!",5
"Stayed at this hotel for two weeks in October 2014.  All the usual facilities you would expect from a four star hotel. All Spa rooms very large with good size baths and walk in showers. Wi Fi and Sky TV provided. Breakfast very good, choices of almost everything on offer. Let down by having no International Cuisine restaurant, only a Bistro with limited menu and Saffrons, Indian themed high end  ( nouvelle cousine ) restaurant which, if you had as many cream teas as myself, was adequate, no more. And of course, don't forget to take your own pillows. The ones in our room were so hard and despite requesting softer pillows they were unable to offer suitable replacements  so we had to buy some in the town which we left upon departing. You might get lucky. To finish on a positive…",3
Stayed for 7 nights as a birthday treat for my husband. The hotel had been recommended and we were not disappointed. The service in the cafe aroma and the lounge bar were excellent as was the reception staff. We enjoyed the pool and spa area. It is a good 15 mins walk to town with a steep rise returning to the hotel but this would not put us off returning.,5
"We spotted a deal on Expedia offering flights and accommodation to Hotel de France  that was just in the budget. We thought we may stand a better chance of sunshine, but without the long drive south to Devon/ Cornwall etc from 'up north' (Merseyside). Arrived at HdF early afternoon. I had seen reports about the approach to the hotel. There is a sign on a wall at the start of the drive in, but the building you see is the medical centre in front. Don't be alarmed, the hotel ( surprisingly, considering it's size), is 'hiding' behind.  Quite an impressive building .We were  greeted by a porter who took our bags, check in no problem. Then shown to our room by the porter. Felt I should tip him, but neither of us had change :-/.  We'd booked a spa room for a small supplement, these are…",4
"i have been staying at the General De France for a number of years now and have always found it to be very clean, friendly and reasonable on cost. The staff are very good & always helpful. Can't fault the place really.",5
"From the moment we set foot into the hotel we felt very welcome.the hotel was exceptionally clean, food was great. The staff service was nothing short of exceptionally brilliant. I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting jersey. I can't wait to come back..... ",5
Had the most fantastic overnight stay at The Hotel de France. I upgraded to a spa room and pleased that I did. Super room really comfortable. We dined in Saffrons and the staff could not be more attentive if they tried. The food and experience was amazing. booking up again today.,5
"My boyfriend & I stayed at the Hotel de France for a romantic stay & we booked their 'Spa room' it was a wonderful room, very large & the decor was very pleasant,  we had an amazing view over all of St Helier & the sea too, we live in Jersey & still the view from our room was so very beautiful we appreciated it very much, not what we would get to see if at home. The staff were wonderful & couldn't do more to ensure we had the best memorable experience. The facilities within the Ausha Spa are the very best we have experienced & we have been to a number of hotels that offer the same experience & facilities however this was by far a truly perfect stay & experience. Thank you Hotel de France & kind staff.",5
"After navigating the one way streets and closed roads (due to a festival), it was a welcome relief to arrive at the Hotel de France. I was unable to see the hotel from the road due to the medical centre that blocks it, but there is an easy-to-see hotel sign at the entrance to the driveway. The spacious lobby, with its sweeping staircase, was very quiet when we arrived and check in was quick and efficient. The room was clean and comfortable and provided a view of the grassy area and St Helier in the distance. The highlights of my stay were definitely the spa and breakfast. The spa was clean and consists of a variety of pools, spas, plunge pools, steam rooms, and both indoor and outdoor relaxation areas. Breakfast was an extensive spread of almost every breakfast food imaginable…",4
"We've just come back from an overnight stay at this hotel. Check in was quick although not much explanation. We luckily were allocated in a room at the front of the hotel so we had a nice view overlooking St Helier. We had a 2 hours treatment booked but we used the Spa facilites first. When we went into it we thouht it was a very impressive Spa. It made us feel very relaxed and you have all you need and more. The treatment was amazing! The girls did it great, really worth trying! The bedroom was a bit dated but you don't need much more for an overnight.  Dinner at Cafe Aromas was above expectations, great presentation and delicious flavours. Staff was polite and friendly. We definetely recommend the Spa 100%!!",4
"This is what an excellent hotel should be like. Checking-in is easy. The rooms are superb (we had a Spa Room, but we heard that the 'ordinary' rooms are also of a very high standard). There is a good choice of food at breakfast (waiter service if you order hot food) and it is all excellent. We ate in the Aroma cafe a few times and again the service and the food was excellent. We didn't use the spa or the pool, but from what we could see the facilities all looked to be of a very high standard. All of the staff are very professional. The Hotel de France offers a very high standard of service and accommodation, and my wife and I could not fault it on any count. If we ever stay in Jersey again, this is the hotel we will choose. I only have nice things to say about this hotel and…",5
We have stayed in this hotel before and the standard of rooms and service are excellent. Breakfast is great to set you up for the day as there is a wide variety available. In addition there is the Aroma restaurant and bar where there is a good choice of meals available at reasonable prices and the quality and portions are also good. As we do not drive the free courtesy bus into St Helier town is especially useful and runs for or five times a day and you can also arrange to be picked up at certain times.,5
"Arrived after 9pm for a 2 night stay, reception staff very friendly and explained where i could still eat. Bedroom was a Spa room, very comfortable, normal supplies of tea/coffee and biscuits. My room had a balcony with sturdy furniture and in an excellent condition, no plastic here thank goodness. Air conditioning worked, flat screen TV and a shower separated from the bath. Disabled facilities as well which was good to see. Great nights  sleep as the room was very quiet even though there was a big event going on below. Breakfast was help yourself with a great choice and well replenished by chef, Tea and coffee was served by waiting staff who cleared plates quickly and efficiently. Both English and Continental readily available. Soft seating area to read papers that were…",5
"It was our first trip to Jersey, chose this hotel because it offered everything that we were looking for, lovely large room with balcony overlooking St Helier, very clean, with plenty of towels, coffee/tea making bits, etc. The staff were very helpful and friendly, lovely meals, would definitely stay there again, and recommend to friends.",5
Had a great time loved our stay. The hotel the staff the food the location everything about our stay was 100%. Will definitely go again and couldn't recommend it highly enough.  Have stayed in a few hotels both in Jersey and Guernsey This tops them all. Hope you go and enjoy as much as we did.,5
"Stayed 1 Night in Oct 14. was Delighted that it has an Indian Restaurant called ""Saffron""! Room Service may not be available for this Indian Restaurant's delicious dishes .. So please request and if they are not busy, they will make an exception. I had Yellow Dal and Basmati Rice with Fresh Yoghurt. The Dal Was Excellent! Reminded me of Home Food ... The Basmati Rice however should have been Long Grained and should have not been coloured Yellow. however the fresh Yoghurt was delightfully creamy and overall I had a great Room Service Dining Experience! A very nice touch is the under floor heating in the Bathroom and it felt very good to get into it from the carpeted room, to be surprisingly delighted that the tiled floor was not jarringly cold but welcomingly warm! We stayed on…",4
"Yes it's a lovely hotel.  The rooms are rather small and lacking in any colour, the bathroom needed refurbishment.  It was the little things like the housekeeping forgetting to leave bathrobes and slippers, or bathmat one day or enough milk.  Like not telling us about the TV room so my husband didn't get to see the Ryder Cup.  Like not giving good info on where to get the free shuttle back to the hotel from St. Helier.  Also the menus in the room not being the same as in the restaurant, out dated.  The room service menu was also a little boring, we were not well enough to go down for dinner for 2 nights and couldn't find anything on the list that we fancied......the sandwiches for after 10pm not before.  The staff were very welcoming and the spa (pools) were lovely but the Ayush…",4
"Chose hotel partly because of friends recommendation and because it had a spa and pool. Car parking easy, plenty of spaces in various places within grounds. Check In easy, staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was very good, clean, tidy, overlooking garden and town. Bathroom fine with plenty of towels, gels, etc. Orangery Restaurant for breakfast was very nice. Brilliant selection of food available. Hot food was in containers with lids that ensured it did not dry out. Used Aroma Cafe for a meal, quality of food exceeeded our expectations. Did not use Saffrons for meal. Had a drink in the bar, prices not cheap but did not expect it to be. Used the pool, sauna and steam room and they were very good. Celebrating our Ruby Wedding  Anniv. Hotel had put complimentary fruit and…",5
"We checked in and were lucky enough to be given a complimentary upgrade on our room. Room was great, spacious and clean. The bed was very comfy and everything we could have needed was there. Used the spa whilst we were there and thoroughly enjoyed it. Facilities were great! All the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. I would recommend the afternoon tea, great value.  We would love to go back! ",5
"Excellent hotel, brilliant location. very friendly and helpful staff, nice spa, nice room which was very clean, good food.  Their Saffrons restaurant was one of the best we have been to. we went there on our first night and had the tasting menu, it was simply sublime, so we went back on our last night and chose off the a la carte menu.  Truly another memorable meal.  This chef Rufinder Singh deserves a michelin star, as he is up there with the best.  Excellent.",5
"We had an overnight stay bought for us as a thank you and stayed in the Spa rooms which are excellent. We had a wonderful view over town and could even see the sea. The evening sunset was amazing. Rooms were well maintained being exceptionally clean and has a small in room fridge bar. The Spa facilities are simply the best in the Island. A large pool, hot pool, cold dip and jacuzzi pool. Treatments are upstairs and are fantastic from start to finish. The relaxation rooms allows a lovely finish to the treatment. The cafe serves great food and staff throughout the hotel are excellent. ",5
"Spent one night at Hotel de France as my partner had a business meeting on Monday morning in St Helier.  What an amazing place.  Extremely clean, pleasant and friendly staff and the best Spa I have been to - to me better than Champneys.  I had a treatment which was also better than any I have had before.  This brief visit has left me wanting to go back and spend longer at this hotel and see more of Jersey.",5
"I stay at the Hotel de France usually twice a year and value for money, quality and helpfulness of staff it is one of the finest on the Island .Quite an achievement considering most things on Jersey offer high quality and exacting standards. The rooms are comfortable and the Spa is fantastic. Location is good with St Helier a short walk . Breakfast are excellent offering a substantial selection of choice largely using Jersey produce",5
we had a quids in deal for the afternoon tea and overnight stay and it was lovely. For a small extra charge we got an upgrade to a bigger room and it was beautiful. We had a great view over the town centre.,5
"Fantastic accommodation, terrific food, fab room/amenities and great location - what more could you ask for + the sun shone! The staff were friendly and courteous throughout my 3 day stay and I could not fault the hotel with a comfortable/large bedroom and plentiful sunloungers to laze in the gardens or by the pool whilst attentive waiters provided top notch service. Happy days!",5
"I always stay at the Hotel de France whenever I am in Jersey (several times a year). It's close to the centre of town; it's quiet; it does a good breakfast; it has lots of parking; the hotel pool is fabulous; there is good WIFi in the rooms, which are a good size. The hotel cafe does excellent food for days when I'm too tired to walk into town. It ticks all the boxes!",5
"My partner and I decided to pick up on a deal for an overnight stay with afternoon tea, breakfast and use of the spa facilities. We both live locally but thought we would arrange a well deserved treat, this was the best hotel on the island that we could have picked for our mini break. Although we had not even left our parish, we felt like we were somewhere much further away and so quiet! We found the outside areas a real bonus on other hotels we had stayed at, we could hardly bare to leave the spa facilities and the weather was great so the cafe terrace was a perfect setting for our afternoon tea (with cheeky bottle of prosecco). The staff were really welcoming, effecient and friendly. The food at Cafe Aroma is fantastic, spa facilites - best on the island! No regrets.",5
some of my family  live in jersey so once a year I visit .its the first time that I stayed at the hotel de france  and I will stay there again .its clean and well equipped and has the best pool I have ever seen /used .the staff are friendly without being too ;;in your face;; .I am disabled the only slight problem I had was no walk in shower in my room .but other than that the room was clean and a good size for a single .the weather was in the high 20s when I went so it made the stay even better .breakfast was excellent .I had my  main meal with my daughter so I can't pass comment on the restaurant. the hotel is located on an incline so if you're incapacitated  in any way please bear this in mind .you can get to the main entrance with a car but if you are walking or have a…,5
"The Afternoon tea was excellent, more than we could manage and the surroundings on the terrace were very pleasant. our room was comfortable and the buffet breakfast was also very good. service was efficient and helpful. all in all good value and good service",4
"This is the first time I have had to write a negative review, but I really felt compelled to do so after a very disappointing one night stay at Hotel De France.  It is a beautiful old hotel and the spa was wonderful, but the room we stayed in was really rather awful for a four star hotel, and what's more, we paid extra to upgrade! We stayed in room 218, a spa room in the newer wing... a very clinical soulless place in my opinion.   So the room - It was so incredibly bland with dreadful peach walls, two scruffy armchairs which are totally out of place, and just so underwhelming! I think they describe these rooms as 'contemporary', but that certainly isnt the word I would use.  There were no curtains (!!), I really expected curtains in a four star hotel! But instead there were two…",3
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel de France. We had only a small room, but had a sea view from the 3rd floor. The only real criticism was the heat in the room. We initially though that the windows opened only a little, but then found the secret to unlocking them fully. Despite this, and a fan on in our room all night, we were still warm. Air conditioning would raise this from a 4 star to a five star review.  Breakfast very good (some waiting staff a bit keen though - twice during the week there was an attempt to take away my plate even though I hadn't quite finished and still had a spoon in my hand!). I was OK with the décor although some reviewers don't seem to like it.  Attractive garden and terrace to sit out on and have a drink (or even dinner). Afternoon tea looked…",4
"Good Hotel in good elevated position, good restaurants, very nice leisure centre with swimming pool. Staff very helpful, when taxi did not arrive to take us to airport, they took us there in the hotel mini bus. Ten-minute walk to town via a well laid out Millennium Park. The local bus does stop just outside the hotel, which will take you as far as you want to go on the island for £1.80.",4
"After three stays with bigger groups. My OAP's had been very pleased about the excellent Service! Including excellent breakfast with a  plentiful of choice. May be one of the best breakfst in town... Very nice and fine Spa with a Swimming, whirl pool, Sauna, big pool etc. really properly Held !!! Dinner with French rafinesse & excellent Service! Good wining choice and reasonable Price for a settled 4 Star sup. (Tour guide in F.and GB.)",5
"We stayed here for a midweek stay. The Spa room was one of the best we've stayed in, just lovely. Staff all very helpful and attentive. It's a lovely building although hidden behind the medical centre. Adequate parking if you hire a car. Bit of a walk from St Helier but this didn't bother us. We enjoyed the breakfasts but didn't eat in any of the restaurants so can't comment on those. Spa facilities also very nice.",5
Single person was fine but expect a single bed! Really clean reception. Was going to use the spa for a massage but they were quite expensive. Terrace was great for watching the lightening. I would definitely go back.,5
"Overall the hotel is lovely, and we had a lovely but short honeymoon stay here.  On our first night we turned up with no luggage due to an airline problem, we requested complimentary toothbrush/ toothpaste and were told to purchase from the onsite shop, given that holiday inn would fulfil this request it left us quite surprised. We felt the service by reception staff was hit and miss, some very stand offish and some very helpful.  We loved the spa and had we had longer I would have used it even more.  The breakfast room was very dated and did not meet the levels of décor found throughout the rest of the hotel but the offerings at breakfast were good quality and plentiful.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.",4
"Impressive facade initially hidden by an uninspiring medical centre. It's a little bit of a walk from St Helier town centre and the last hill up to the hotel (about 100 metres from the road to the door) is STEEP. There are steps but if you're unfit or get easily short of breath bear this in mind. There is ample parking and a cycle store which the staff opened promptly for us each day. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking St Helier. Lovely view. Room is a little decoratively bland but clean, good size with tea/coffee making facilities. Small TV and free wi-fi. Big problem was the heat in the room. Windows were open but still very hot and no air conditioning. We asked for a fan which stayed on for our entire stay and for sheets that we used instead of the duvets (also for…",4
"We recently had our third stay in a row in this hotel. There was never a reason to complain, but this time we were not satisfied at all.   Upon arrival everything went wrong. I booked two single rooms for my mother and me three month in advance. As she got a heart attack a few years ago I asked for two rooms close to each other. That worked well the last two years so we expected no trouble with this request this time.  At the reception we made the encounter with a german receptionist. We met her before and I was aware she is not one of the warm hearted persons. She did not even notice us and we were greeted by one of her colleagues. He made the checkin and turned his head to her asking „upgrade“? She turned her head to him and replied „no upgrade“. We never wanted or expected an…",3
"This is a top class hotel with well-trained staff, extensive and impressive facilities, and a seriously progressive main restaurant featuring fine dining of Indian flavours.  After a ropey first night with a noisy wedding party and a hot room, management dealt efficiently and admirably with my discontent. My thanks to the staff who turned a tricky start into a marvellous stay on the island.  The spa and pool facilities are some of the best I've enjoyed, impeccably clean and well-managed.  Saffron restaurant reviewed separately.   Continental weather throughout the week certainly helped, but Hotel De France was a large part of a holiday week that was memorable.",4
"Purchased deal for afternoon tea and overnight stay. We live in Jersey, so this was the ultimate staycation for our wedding anniversary. Upgraded to spa room with balcony, so spacious, so perfect. Afternoon tea amazing on roasting hot sunny terrace and two courses in their amazing indian haute cuisine restaurant Saffron in the evening absolutely sublime. Professional properly trained attentive staff (a rarity nowadays). Spa facilities amazing. Great to see things from a tourist's perspective. What a high value product. No need to have the hassle of airport etc. Shut yourself away here in Jersey and enjoy what this amazing hotel has to offer. Well done Hotel de France. You are all a credit to Jersey.",5
A nice comfortable hotel with an excellent swimming pool and outside garden area and balcony. Whilst not by the sea the front facing room on the upper floor gave a nice view over St Helier out to the sea. Whilst a fan and cooling unit in the room it would be better with full ventilation. Cream tea a must!. ,4
"This is a lovely hotel with excellent facilities which is let down by their staff.  On arriving the leaving the hotel you are rarely acknowledged and if you ask for something a little unusual in the Aroma Cafe your are viewed as a problem.  You are given the menu which states that there are specials in small writing and these are on black boards in the room but if like us you are chatting you may not have noticed these and they are not pointed out to you.  Breakfast is excellent with a lot of choice but not always well stocked when busy - they appear to be unable to keep up with demand.    Would go again, but the staff need some basis hospitality training.",4
"Superb hotel, one of the best Spas i have ever been in, great sauna & steam rooms, fantastic hot stone massage by Kavita, well worth the money. Great food. Will definately stay again next time i'm in Jersey.",5
"Brilliant staff, excellent food, very clean. Stayed with my children and couldn't be any happier. Hotel is amazing and so grand looking. Pools are well kept and clean. My children loved the hotel and jersey itself.",5
"We were impressed with the whole ambience of the hotel. Staff were  friendly, the breakfasts were superb, our room  was immaculate, car parking was quite adequate whilst we were there, and we cannot fault the entire holiday. Did not utilise the spa facilities so cannot make any comment. They did look a bit pricey though !. Waiter service  in the restaurant and on the terrace was good, friendly and helpful.In short - excellent, and we will visit again.",5
"We have just returned from our second trip to Jersey and our second stay at Hotel de France. This hotel is a fantastic place to stay in St. Helier, with the town centre a 10min walk away. Every staff member from reception to waiter/waitress are so helpful and will go above ad beyond to help if you need it. Pool facilities are 10/10 and rooms are well decorated and spotless. See you all soon Hotel de France. ",5
"We stayed again in spacious and well appointed spa rooms with a great view over St. Helier. All staff, without exception, were friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make us feel welcome. Service was prompt, breakfast had a wide choice and was well prepared. Good choice for evening dining and we also enjoyed relaxing with drinks and snacks on the terrace. Excellent indoor pool area and garden. The hotel is spotless inside and well kept outside.",5
"I truly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel de France.  The spa is amazing, although I have to say that the treatments are a bit on the pricey side.  I had a hot stone massage and was charged £95 for an hour and twenty minutes of treatment.  Great gym and an impressive indoor pool area (there are 3 pools to choose from!) although the main pool is on the small side and isn't suitable to swim in for fitness.  I came to Jersey on business and stayed in a single room which was amply sized for a very short stay.  The only downside though is that there is no AC in the room and it can get quite warm.  The bed is also right next to the radiator, which to me, could be a potential for injury.    Service was amazing, everyone was friendly and eager to help.  However, I have to personally commend…",4
"We bought the overnight stay on a deal we got afternoon tea which was brilliant all home made cakes served by excellent staff,Our evening meal was just has good served in the same place Aroma Restraunt .A good choice of food for breakfast.The room we stayed was clean and spacious.Great Stay",4
Superb location the walk back from the town centre can be a little tiring The size and quality our room was wonderful with a view over St Helier to the port.  The food was amazing and a huge choice. All the staff were very friendly and provided exceptional service all round. Not one complaint.,5
"A good holiday is the sum of its parts - the holiday location itself and the accommodation you stay in.  The island of Jersey and the Hotel de France ticks both boxes.  The hotel itself is going through a period of transition as it has scaled back on the number of rooms, but having stayed there on our family holiday for a number of years now, it has not lost its appeal.  The staff are friendly and welcoming, making you feel special from the moment you check in until check-out at the end of your stay.  The food is excellent, with a great range of options for breakfast to set you up for the day.  The standard of service and the leisure facilities are also first class.  In short, the Hotel de France went a long way to making our holiday as enjoyable as it was and I would recommend…",5
"rooms are clean but very basic. The spa however is fantastic, one of the best designed in a hotel that I have been too, complete with good sized swimming pool. Around 20 minute walk to the centre of St Hellier, rooms at the front have views of the bay.",4
"It's our second visit to this lovely hotel. Last year we stayed in a standard double, which was more than adequate. This year we stayed in a club room and a spa room (we stayed in two different rooms as the hotel was nearly fully booked so they offered to accommodated us in the club room for the same price as the cheaper spa room) Both rooms were spacious and clean and definitely worth paying extra for. Breakfast was always hot and fresh with an excellent choice of both hot and continental food  available. The spa was amazing and never too crowded even though the hotel was fully booked. We ate at Saffron which one of the two restaurant within  the hotel. It might seem pricey but the service and food were both exquisite. We also went to the carvery night, which is on a Sunday…",5
"We enjoyed staying in the hotel. I was there with my wife and daughter of 11, sharing the same room. We had a large executive room on the 2nd floor. The room was very spacious. It even had a small dressing room between the bathroom and the bedroom.  The hotel is very close to town and boasts great Spa facilities.  I wasn't too impressed by the restaurant but the service was excellent.",5
"Good location. Room was clean and acceptable. Breakfast was fantastic. Service and staff very good. Top class swimming pool. Nothing too much trouble. Would definitely stay at Hotel De France again, without doubt.",5
"This hotel is beautiful, perfect location, staff are brilliant spa is beautiful. Couldn't ask for anything more, made my sisters hen weekend incredible!! Would be happy to stay here again when we return to jersey next year!!",5
"Just back from a weekend at the Hotel de France.    An excellent stay - rooms were spacious and clean, the hotel met our request made at the time of booking to allocate nearby rooms for our family group and the breakfast buffet is very good indeed.  The spa and pool is really good - ideal for a relaxing weekend break - and we ate at the hotel's bistro restaurant on the first night which was good quality and reasonable value.   We didn't use the main hotel restaurant - which is Indian fusion-themed.   Hote gardens were a delight and with some great weather over the weekend, relaxing on a sunlounger in the garden was wonderful.  The only slight challenge we had was trying to achieve the right balance of temperature overnight - duvets are about 3,000 tog and so even with aircon…",5
"Great welcome, polite and helpful and attentive staff. The food was excellent. The Indian specialty restaurant was good. Secure car parking on site was a bonus. Within easy walking distance of town. An enjoyable place to stay",5
"Nice hotel in a good location. Friendly staff and a comfortable room, Location is very convenient and the island of Jersey is a lovely place to visit anytime of year. We didn't use the car park as we just hired bikes to get around the island.",4
"Nice hotel, I stayed in a spa room with balcony very nice and very quiet at night. Food good and service efficient. This was a business trip but I'm planning to return with my husband and stay here and contain to explore Jersey.",4
"We read this hotel had been used by the Germans as an officer training centre during the occupation years so it certainly has a lot of history.  It's a very nice building with some interesting architectural features.    It's not exactly conveniently located as it's quite some distance from the town or the beach but as we were there on business, it wasn't too much of an effort for us.  The restaurants are very good and the breakfasts are excellent.    The rooms are comfortable and as it's so far from the roads, it's very quiet at night but despite the anti-seagull nets and wires in the hotel gardens, they still screech you awake early every morning.    The spa, pool and gym areas are very well equipped so there's lots to do indoors if the weather isn't too clever.",4
"The hotel facilities are excellent nod the rooms lovely.  The buffet breakfasts were not nearly hot enough, the cafe restaurant was terrible with over cooked food and terrible presentation. The main restaurant was eastern style cuisine and very expensive. I would not go back there but would go back to Jersey which is a lovely island with very pleasant nod helpful people.",2
"We have stayed at the Hotel de France before and both times we were very pleased.  Yes, there are cheaper places to stay but if you want comfort, quality and a bit of pampering then this is the place for you.  The main plus points for us were: we were treated as important guests and the staff were always ready to help; the food is very good and there's plenty of it! and the overall facilities are excellent.  The rooms are generally well appointed and well serviced.  The breakfast's are brilliant and varied.  Make sure you have an afternoon tea with traditional Jersey cream scones...Mmmm!",5
"My partner and I recently stayed at Hotel de France. I had high expectations being a member of the gym and spa which is part of the hotel. I cannot fault the gym/spa, it is the best in Jersey. However the first room we were offered, room 324 was beside the lift on the third floor. It felt like the lift was actually in the room, very noisy and totally unacceptable for a hotel charging prices like this. The decor is pretty poor and dated. Really not what we expected at all. I asked to be moved. The next room was marginally better. Same decor. If it hadn't been so difficult to book alternative accommodation we would have left. The restaurants and bar are very good. Staff there are helpful and knowledgable about food and drink. However the staff at reception need further training in…",3
"As a spa user all over the world facilities are up there with the best.  Standard Room is great and everyting is thought out to ensure a great stay.  Saffron is definately a must.   Staff are so friendly and accododating and real people.  Cannot wait to go back.   Spoke to people who are staying a month at a time and can see why. .   Specially mention that the hotel does not run a hotel schuttle bus every day but when we thought it was available but was not, they stepped in straight away and amd made our perception a reality  - you cannot fault the reaction of the staff.  Breakfast was top notch.",5
Had a wonderful stay here recently. Very clean and comfortable room with good amenities. Breakfast was delicious with ample choices. Sadly we were unable to try the spa and pool as we were busy all weeken but we plan to revisit for a holiday and intend to book here.,5
"This hotel is excellent, the pool area is fantastic with a pool large enough to seem in, the steam room and sauna is an added bonus  The only thing is for people with mobility the entrance is quite steep  But I would return  I used to live in Jersey and this is the first home I had visited the hotel  Excellent staff  ",5
very friendly staff and well trained in hospitality.  Food cant fault.  This is our second stay and will stay again.  Would highly recommend.  Would like to have been offered a DBB rate but not many hotel seem to offer this in Jersey.,5
"Love this hotel.  The staff are so helpful and friendly. Food is excellent for breakfast, the cafe and the main restaurant. The spa facilities is one of the best in jersey with a good variety in the pool area and a beautiful spa area above. Room are clean, spacious and comfortable.",5
"I cannot honestly fault this hotel in any way. It was one of the most enjoyable breaks we have ever had. The facilities are top class, especially the spa area with a wonderful pool, sauna, steam room, plunge pool, hot tub etc. Same goes for the spa treatments and treatment rooms - best I have ever seen. Cafe Aroma has a good varied menu suitable for everyday eating whilst the Saffron restaurant offers a more upmarket dinning experience, both did not disappoint in the slightest. Lovely lounge bar area with big leather armchairs, beautiful terrace for eating / drinking, great wine list, all reasonably priced. Staff all very helpful and polite. We will definitely be going back.",5
"Stayed here for 3 nights with my partner, checked in early wasn't a problem, asked for a fan for our room wasn't a problem, amazing view from our room, room was very clean, pools were lovely, cafe at the hotel had a good choice for a one off lunch, there was a minibus that picked you up from the hotel and took you into town and would bring you back again at certain times throughout the day, the buffet breakfast was amazing such good choice and quality, overall a lovely place to stay!",5
"This was my first ever trip to Jersey, and the hotel certainly did not disappoint.  It is a good 15-20 minute walk into the main town centre, but it is worth it.  The rooms are immaculate with huge comfortable beds, everything you need and are quiet too so a good nights sleep.  The spa is one of the best I have come across great pool, Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna.  The staff at the hotel are really pleasant and helpful, look forward to a return visit.",5
"Very clean hotel. However, rooms looking a little bit dated.  I have also an issue with thin walls. I spent 2 nights listening to my neighbour snoring. I travel a lot and have never had this issues with any other hotel. It was if the snorers were in my room. Staff in the dining areas a little bit amateurish and I watched them clear away people's breakfast when the person had just gone up to get toast at the buffet. Bit more training would be useful.  Otherwise food good and reasonably priced.  ",3
"Hotel de France is an impressive hotel situated close to central st helier.  The hotel has an impressive facade, sadly the interior of the hotel and rooms appears dated. The room was very large and had a small living room part and then a study??  The staff however are very friendly and welcoming and the food especially in the saffron a restaurant was outstanding.   The free spa facilities with sauna, steam room and pools were brilliant. Would recommend but feel some of it needs updating.",4
"The staff at this hotel were wonderful, cheerful, helpful and welcoming. We had a 'king room' which was massive.  The bed soooo comfortable.  Our fourth floor room was at the rear of the hotel and so the views were not great, but not great worry for us.  The setting/grounds for the hotel are not great, this part of St Helier is not attractive and the buildings around the hotel are a disaster, but get past these and you'll have a great stay.  Breakfast in the Orangery was wonderful, an array of cooked, fruits, cereals...always fresh and attended to by the chef - constant supplies being brought out.  Attentive staff.  In the evening we ate a number of times in the 'Cafe Aroma', with fantastic food.  Mostly well served (although one night they seemed to be disorganised and slow (a…",5
"I'm lying on the comfiest, biggest (seems larger than usual) kingsize bed in the biggest hotel room I can recall staying in uploading this review via the free wifi. The room is modern, bright and tastefully appointed and immaculately clean. The hotel itself appears in very good repair and is clean and tastefully decorated in keeping with its grand historical architecture and immaculate throughout. The staff are very competent, friendly and helpful in the bar, saffrons restaurant (see separate review), the breakfast room and reception. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had, they have everything from continental cold cuts, smoked salmon and cheese to pastries, cereals, fresh fruit and juices with yoghurt and seeds etc to the full English (including delicious black…",5
"Very happy with my stay here.  The hotel itself is pretty big, with a couple of restaurants (one quite reasonable, one pretty expensive) and a great buffet breakfast, but it's the spa that really makes it.  The seventh best spa in Europe according to one magazine, and I could well believe it.    It enjoys an elevated position over St Helier so is a bit of a hike from the town centre.  There's a courtesy bus but it only runs a few times a day, and whilst it's on a couple of the main bus service's routes as well I was surprised how early some of the buses stop running in Jersey, so be prepared for a walk or for taxis.  They also need a bigger bar for the size of the place.  The one they have is great and I managed to get a seat every time, but there was a lot of moving around of…",4
"My husband and I visited St Helier, Jersey in July 2014. I called Jersey.com and discussed our accommodation needs. I was directed to the Hotel de France and it turned out to be a perfect choice. From the moment we walked through the doors until we left, we were very much treated as VIP's. Well done to all the staff, from the desk personnel to the restaurant staff, to the concierge!! We had an absolutely brilliant week in Jersey, with a great deal of the credit going to you!!! Many, many thanks, and if we happen to visit again, we will certainly have no hesitation to coming back to  the Hotel de France. kind regards, Marian & David Fox",5
"First time we had stayed here, but hopefully not the last.  Where to start?!  First, no issue with parking.  We had travelled in a large hire car and found the parking to be more than adequate, both spaces to park and space to park in.  The staff, whilst always professional, were also always friendly and welcoming.  Our double room on the second floor was very clean and well presented.  The view out over the grounds (extremely well maintained) and St Helier and to the sea was fantastic.  The hotel sits quite hight for Jersey and it is very quiet there at all times.  Breakfast was a pleasant and relaxing experience with lots of choice.  The staff were attentive but not over-bearing.  Wish we had stayed there longer and very much hope to make a return at some point soon :)",5
"This is no ordinary Hotel. From the moment you step through the doors it soon becomes obvious that this is a special Hotel. Our room on the 4th floor has wonderful views of St Helier and the sea. The pool area is just gorgeous and so relaxing. The breakfast is great with a vast choice. For lunch time/ evening, we have eaten a few times at the Aroma restaurant and the food is good. The best thing about this hotel is their staff. All full of smiles and all very helpful. In my opinion this is the best Hotel I have stayed in. I will not hesitate coming back to this a hotel in future.",5
"We have just returned from the hotel de France after spending 3nights there our room was on the 5th floor,very clean good decor,breakfast buffet plenty of choices staff very attentive, polite, @ couldn't do enough for you, we found that any member of staff you met you were always treated with respect, would recommend this hotel ",5
"We stayed in mid August for 6 nights. The approach to the hotel is disappointing and does not give a good impression as you drive through a medical centre and various car parks and think , oh no what have we done ! However once you get to the hotel it is lovely . Rooms are small and a little dated but quite adequate . We had a few minor issues . On arrival I went to the hair salon to book a blow dry but was told in no uncertain terms by a really miserable woman that they were fully booked for the whole of my stay . No attempt was made to help or assist as she thrust the book across the desk at me repeating , fully booked ! fully booked see ! On our second night we ate in the restaurant and signed the receipt as is usual to charge the bill to our room . At around midnight we were…",4
"we were here for 4 nights and was just ok for what we paid the room was not worth it no dressing growns or irons in the room which i think for a 4 star hotel this should be in place we were on the top floor so just a blind on the window no curtains to black out the light the room was very clean so well done to the house keeping sfaff. the breakfast was just ok  the staff  would need to smile and say good morning to the guests and it seemed to be a bother to get us coffee and never was butter on the table, they seem to be looking at the watches all the time and did not make us feel comfortable the food its self was ok as the cooked breakfast was always cold and the eggs was never cooked right we were frightened to ask for the al a cart breakfast which was a shame as we should of…",3
"We stayed here for 5 nights. Would have to agree with all the positive comments on here. The staff were very helpful, the hotel decor is plush and the breakfasts are good.  The two standout features include the Spa/pool area which are an excellent part of the hotel and worth a visit to. The outstanding Saffron restaurant is worth visiting too. We had booked there for our first night and weren't sure what to expect but it was a top class meal, which we thoroughly enjoyed, it was one of those meals you didn't want to end. We also visited the carvery night on the Sunday, and although it was not the same quality as the previous night, it was a good value carvery meal. Cafe aroma was also good for a spot of lunch. Unfortunately the weather was poor so we didn't get a chance to sit…",4
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for almost a week. During that time we were made welcome by the staff, and enjoyed the pool and spa facilities. The public areas of the hotel are really nice and well looked after, however we found the bedroom a bit disappointing. Whilst it was clean and not shabby, it was dull and a bit dated. The walls were plain magnolia with nothing on them and the furniture a 'traditional' pine bed, dressing table and mirror. Not the largest of rooms either (we had a standard double). Personally I found the bed really uncomfortable as well, but I know this is subjective. However if you're not planning on spending a lot of time in your room, the rest of the hotel was really nice. Breakfast is good, the pool area is very good and prices reasonable for a hotel.",4
Stayed here 14-16 August 2014.  Group of 6 accommodated in 3 rooms (via Expedia who's site only allowed group bookings of same room type but follow up with hotel to change one to a twin without any problem).  Helped by bellhop at check-in (which went very smoothly) and headed to our rooms.  We were on the top floor (502) and 4th floor (402/403).  Rooms a little small and a touch dated but more than sufficient for the small amount of time we were staying  (I think there's an updated part of the hotel with more modern rooms?)  Only slight criticism was size of the TV in the room (tiny!) but watched very little.  They have all UK and main French channels and some German/Italian in case you're interested!  Only ate breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurants. …,5
"I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff and facilities were top notch and in a great location. Walking distance to Center, the walk is a nice one with a historical church and other historical buildings. Within the hotel there is a nice spa and pool which was not usually busy and a few good restaurants in the hotel. Would stay there again in a heart beat ",5
"I have stayed in this hotel several years ago whilst on business in Jersey.  At that time the Standard Double was a modern freshly decorated room with aircon. We stayed as a family in July 2014, and on arrival as requested we were allocated a family room but we found that this room was very dated, had no aircon and they had not placed the extra child bed in the room for us.  We asked to change rooms but they were fully booked. The staff were extremely helpful though and promptly addressed the missing bed and shortly afterwards a portable aircon unit was brought up, which after several hours of running managed to reduce the room temperature to a manageable level.  The weather on the island was fabulous during our stay resulting in high temperatures everyday.  The spa facilities…",3
"We have just had a fantastic weeks stay at hotel du France. We booked via booking.com and have never had a problem using them before.  We booked our rooms and when we arrived at the hotel were horrified too see that the rooms allocated were no not even close to being like those shown on the booking website. To say that. They appeared to have last been updated in the 70's would be kind.   3 rd floor in side wing.  To the hotels credit I took my I pad to reception and said that the rooms we booked were nothing like those we had been given.  The manager agreed and although the hotel was virtually full moved heaven and earth for us to move rooms,  All credit to the hotel itself. During conversation it was intimated to me that they had actually requested booking . Com to amend the…",5
The Hotel de France is a wonderful mix of traditional and modern comforts.  The magnificent old building with a fascinating history combined with the modern spa and terrace bar provide a great venue for a long weekend or longer break.,4
"We have just spent three nights in one of the hotel's spa rooms to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday.  The room was very spacious and modern with a large bathroom and walk in shower. There was a vase of flowers on the side which was a nice touch.   There was also a balcony overlooking St Helier.  The swimming pool and spa were amazing and a door opened onto a sunbathing terrace and lawn where there were plenty of sun loungers.   We ate in both restaurants and the food was good,  although we felt a Saffron was expensive for the portion sizes.  Breakfast was quality if a bit on the cold side.  All the staff were helpful and friendly and gave their knowledge of the area to us.   We would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel but it is a fifteen minute walk to the town…",5
"Stayed at the Hotel de France August 14 and found there service and the staff to be great, we booked a table in there Saffron Restaurant and the food was excellent as was the staff. the room was clean",5
"My husband and I have just spent a fabulous 11 night break in Jersey and were delighted with our choice of hotel. On check in we were informed we had been upgraded to a spa room - great first impression! The room was spacious, clean, bright with a private balcony. The breakfasts were plentiful - continental, cooked breakfasts and you could also order porridge, poached eggs etc at no extra cost. We also ate in the hotel restaurants several times. Saffrons has an upmarket take on Indian food and Cafe Aroma is good for lunches or a light evening meal. The carvery offers excellent value for a 3 course meal - cheaper than anything equivalent we had eaten in St Hellier centre. Good choice of cocktails in the lounge bar too. The spa facilities add that extra ingredient to fully relax…",5
"Having stayed here before I think we were expecting too much? We went for a spa room, these are in the new part of the building. We hoped the room would be warm and welcoming. We found a plain soulless room with no welcome, no warmth or personality. The room was clean but had no freshness, no fragrant welcome which you might expect from a spa room. The bathroom would be great for less able travellers. V wheelchair friendly with the wet room. Also the two leather armchars in the room were ripped and very worn. Bed linens of poor quality!The hotel reception had a fowl smell, I was informed the sand in the ash trays outside needed to be changed. Shame as this was once a great hotel!",3
"We stayed here, as a family of four, with our two children aged under seven. The hotel has a very relaxed atmosphere and all of the staff have a very polite and professional demeanour. It is not a modern building but that is part of its appeal. The hotel was not noisy at any time during our stay. The room was clean and well decorated as were all areas of the hotel. It was very hot during our stay and the room became unbearably hot but, without asking, we received a portable air conditioning unit. I thought that was an amazing attention to detail. The hotel does not particularly cater for children, as there are no kids clubs etc, but our children were made to feel very welcome and enjoyed being 'grown ups'. Our children loved their stay. The hotel is on a hill within walking…",5
"A fantastic find, booked last minute and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were great and very helpful, a fantastic spread of food for breakfast, high standard throughout. Luxury spa/swimming facilities.",5
"Thank you all at the Hotel de France we had a fantasic time at your hotel we could not find any fault with the hotel,in any shape or form very plesant staff very helpfull very polite people, food was fantastic and our room was very comfortable nice and airy nice out look. The spa and swimming pool very nice we cannot fault this hotel recomend",5
"Had to cancel Initial booking at two days notice.Hotel re-booked immediately at no expence. Eventual stay was excellent in all aspects - room spacious, air-con welcome in view of the heat. Aroma restaurant/cafe caters for all tastes with seating inside and out.",5
"Stayed in the hotel in early July as a 4 day birthday break for my wife. The staff were really friendly and welcoming, and the hotel is huge.. I picked the hotel because of the spa facilities in case we had bad weather. Well, the sun was out and it was 26degrees, but it was still nice to come back at the end of the day, and use the spa.  We were allocated room 265, which had a fantastic view looking over the top of St Hellier, and straight to the coast.  All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly, and I would defiantly book to go here again.",5
"We were blessed with lovely weather and the hotel, staff and food were of a very high standard The icing on the cake was the Spa. Wow. This place is top drawer Free parking helps with a free shuttle bus into St Helier The rooms were large, clean and comfortable",5
"We went on a short 5 day holiday to the Hotel de France and we thought we were in 5 star haven.  The hotel reception on our arrival after getting lost round the one way system in St Hellier could not have been more helpful and parked our car for us.  The rooms, service, food and spa we would highly recommend.  It was so peaceful and relaxing and short a short distant to the town centre.  The hotel have a courtesy bus that goes free every day to the town.  We would have rated this hotel a 5 Star.",5
"We had a wonderful weekend staying at this hotel. Excellant first class service from all staff in all depts. The Al la carte menu was superb in Saffron restaurant and the breakfast.was amazing.  The swimming pool, sauna and steam rooms were modern and smart and the garden area lovely and quiet.  The hotel was a short 10-15 mins walk into St Heiler. There is a public bus stop just outside the hotel if you wish to use the bus service. It only took us 15 mins by taxi to get to the airport. The only negative comment is that there was no air conditioning in the bedroom.  We will definantly will be coming back to stay again to try the spa treatments next time.  This was our first visit  to Jersey and we loved it.",4
"We stayed at the Hotel De France last year - The food, hotel, staff, spa and all the facilities you could not fault and we would highly recommend.  When we go back to Jersey we would definitely stay there.  So relaxing it was an absolute pleasure.",5
"very nicely situated on the slope of a hill overlooking St. Helier. Close to the shopping centre. Excellent fairly new swimming pool with sauna and admission to garden. Excellent breakfast buffet, unfortunately in a room with no windows, slightly depressing atmosphere. Rooms nicely equipped and decorated, unfortunately not 'soundproof', you understand every word from the neighbour room.",4
"This is a very impressive older hotel, it is hard to find fault, and certainly is excellent value, it is not expensive for what you get. The setting alone is worth the money, to be perfect it would be closer to the sea, but the staff and management are brilliant, the food good, even if you do not use the wellness centre it has a brilliant infinity pool, which is available to hotel guests, will stay again.",4
"Nice room for a single, clean and modern. It does lack AC but a fan offsets that to a degree. The pool area, bar and breakfast all surpassed expectations and the parking seemed plentiful. If you are going into town leave the car at the Hotel as it is only a ten minute walk.",5
"Having been a director of a hotel chain and an MD of a country estate hotel, I tend to be picky about my ratings, but having said that, the following comments are relevant to all guests:  1. Pre-stay preference requests: requests are never guaranteed for all but the the highest standard hotels, but we requested (a) a quiet room (b) with a nice view, and got a room next to the lift and overlooking the aircon plant equipment.  I made two requests, one at the time of booking and one by phone on the day of check-in.  We were offered a better room the next day (a hassle) or an upgrade to a spa room at a discount.  The cynic in me wondered about the offer, but seeing the difference between a 'superior' room and a spa room, there is no choice.  Book the latter if you can - the space,…",4
I've been to jersey over 20 times and stayed at de France  4 times it as a good pool and gym Food is good rooms are very clean and tidy good bars and gardens are it's not to for to the town And beeches i will be coming back again  My name Summer  age 13 from Rotherham,5

"We very much enjoyed our stay.  Food was very good, except Caesar salad one evening. Room was large with great view of St. Helier and the water.  Bathroom was tiny, too small really, with no place to place much of anything. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful",4
"Excellent hotel. Room was spacious overlooking St Helier and St Aubins bay. Tea/coffee making facilities and ample of coffee and tea. Tiny fridge, but large enough for a bottle of wine etc, safe (which we find unusual in this country, which was free) and air conditioning, which was not noisy!. Buffet breakfast with everything you could think of, grapefruit etc was all fresh, not out of a tin!. Indoor swimming pool was of a decent size, towels and gowns all provided. Well maintained gardens with sun beds available. Will be visiting again.",5
"A lovely stay at this large historic hotel. Ideal if the weather isn't sunny and dry as you can stay in the spa with the pools and saunas, they are as good as the pictures show on their website. Also outdoor access from the pool area so you can have the best of both worlds on a hot sunny day. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and couldn't be faulted, there was a food preference for everyone and plenty of it served in the breakfast room. Our room had a distant view of the town and sea and was picturesque with the balcony/verandah seating area below. This is a nice area to sit and partake in a beverage. ",4
"Lovely Hotel especially public rooms and excellent spa and pools.  The bedrooms were a little disappointing, they were very small, however adequate.  The bathrooms were the same.  The staff were all very helpful especially Concierge, very pleasant too. !",4
"This was a walking holiday & my friend & I booked single rooms for July 2014. This is my 4th trip to Jersey, & 2nd stay at this hotel. It offers good value, being little more expensive than the previous 3* hotels used, but offers a real up-market experience.  The single rooms provided didn't offer any spectacular views, looking out onto an atrium roof, but this didn't bother me. The room was very adequate, well furnished, spotlessly clean, & had a good bathroom with comfortable bath & shower. A comfortable bed ensured a good nights sleep, & there was a flat screen tv, & a useful personal safe in the wardrobe. Free wi-fi is also available with no registration or access restrictions.  Each morning, breakfast was provided with a 3 hour availability in the very large comfortable…",5
"There is no doubt that the Hotel de France looks smart and well maintained.  Unfortunately most of this is just on the surface.  The hotel has no air-conditioning, and when one is billeted in an attic room in the middle of July, this is a major problem.  The breakfast also left a lot to be desired, particularly the service.  On the plus side, the wifi is fast and reliable (and free!).  I only stayed here one night, so decided to grin and bear it.  Had I been there any longer I would have had to find another room, as the roof rooms are unbearable in even slightly hot weather.",3
"We booked this hotel through Great Escapes, which usually deals in luxury accommodation, and which we have found to be excellent in the past, However, the Hotel De France fell somewhat below the standard that we would expect to get on a Secret Escapes weekend.  I emailed the hotel after our stay with my observations and received a fair response. However, the reply only served to underline my opinion that this hotel falls short of Secret Escapes standards. Here is why:  First the plus side:  The staff, without exception, were friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is excellent and there was plenty of comfortable seating available. The building looks magnificent and the public areas are beautiful.  Here's why we wouldn't go back:  Parking is an absolute nightmare. On the days…",3
"We have just returned from a five night stay in this wonderful hotel. The hotel is not visible from the roadside but you cannot fail to be impressed when the hotel comes into view, it is nothing short of spectacular. This continues when you get inside, the sweeping staircase and standard of accommodation is first class. Added to this all the staff are extremely helpful and friendly, nothing is too much trouble.  The standard of food is fantastic, breakfasts you are overwhelmed with choice. We ate four times at Cafe Aroma which has a very varied menu, something to suit everyone and again the standard is first class. We will definitely stay at this hotel again and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone wishing to have a holiday  on this beautiful Island.",5
"Firstly this is a nice hotel, the restaurant in particular was excellent with the chef very attentive to my special dietary needs.  However the bedroom itself was looking tired, both the bath and sink whilst clean were wearing out. The room itself was very warm with no air-con, only a small desktop fan which was too noisy to use during the night.",3
Just walking past and popped in to see what it was like. Restaurant was fairly quiet which can sometimes be an indicator - but not in this case. My butternut squash salad was one of the best meals Ive had on our week's holiday and reasonably priced at 9.50.,5
"We have recently returned from an excellent week at the De France. We were very lucky as the weather was lovely and we saw Jersey at its best. We had a spa room which was lovely and spacious and had a relaxing view over St Helier. The pool and sauna were excellent as were the pretty grounds of the hotel. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the town which is not a problem for mobile people. A taxi to town is about £6. We walked to the town on a number of occasions and got a taxi back. We also hired a car and the De France is also very good as it has a car park. Parking in St Helier is not easy especially with its one way system but having a car to see the rest of the island was a big plus. We had a lovely meal at the Crab Shack at St Brelades Bay, we visited Le Mare Winery which…",4
"Booked this for my son (15) and mother (70+) for 3 nights.  Both loved the stay and found the facilities great. The standard of accommodation was excellent and the staff couldn't do enough for you. My mother felt the brochure pictures don't do it justice..  You aren't right in the centre of St Helier but the hotel have there own shuttle several times a day, you can also use the local service which stops right outside.. From the airport expect to pay about £17 in a taxi.  Would definately recommend ",5
"We are a local group who were celebrating our 30th anniversary, 11 of us enjoyed a meal at the Café Aroma on our first night we hadn't organised a menu but chose individually, the staff, especially John were great the food arrived on time and as we had ordered and was delicious.  8 of us stayed overnight and the rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet, a few of us used the pool, steam room, Jacuzzi and plunge pool and thoroughly enjoyed it.  3 of us stayed for a second night and ate at Saffrons, the service was excellent and the food stunning.  We all agreed that we would be making a repeat performance!",4
"A wonderful hotel, excellent facilities throughout, great food, three restaurants and verandahs to choose from and helpful staff. Pool and spa facilities first class. Also not far from St Helier and all the other facilities that are on offer. Also all very pleasing on the eye.",5
"This hotel is a favourite of ours. We've stayed there before the spa and new pools were built.  The service is excellent, the staff are extremely helpful and very polite, nothing is a problem.  The hotel is situated away from the hub bub of the town but is within walking distance, or you could take advantage of the hotel mini bus.  The food is first class.",5
"We have stayed at this Hotel seven times, twice this year, a week at the end of March and back for two weeks beginning of June. Since 1966 we have stayed at 14 different hotels in Jersey a few more then once and some have been very good but we can honestly say that Hotel De France is the best. We have tried to think of anything that was not to our satisfaction but have drawn a blank. Its 10 out of 10 for friendly and very helpful staff, great breakfast, very comfortable rooms and every where so clean and airey. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day and sit and have a drink on the terrace a absolute delight. In the words of General Macarthur ""we shall return""",5
"Stayed 3 nights as a short break. Light and airy Hotel, fantastic pool, additional massage pool, steam room, sauna. All excellent cleanliness and temperature wise. I had an Indian head and neck massage which was Bliss. The food and service in Aroma Cafe couldn't be faulted. I stayed here last year and intend to return next year.",5
"I have stayed here on numerous occasions and cannot fault the hotel, the staff are really helpful, the food, service and ambience are superb.  As my partner joined me for the weekend, I changed to a delightful double room with a great view of St Helier. We had dinner at Saffrons and had the degustation menu which was superb - really recommend it. We also had some treatments in the spa which were sublime.  The breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had, room service is good and Cafe Aroma is  definitely worth a visit.",5
We enjoyed staying here and using the hotel swimming pool. The hotel is ideally situated to be able to walk into St Helier plus also has plenty of parking. The staff were always friendly and polite and made us welcome. We had our 18 month son with us and they were very easy going with him and he enjoyed his stay too. The staff were helpful when he wasn't well on the first night. The breakfast was brilliant and we used room service each evening. Here is my only criticism we wished they did basic sandwiches/food earlier in the evening rather than just after 10pm for room service.,5
My first time to Jersey and what a great place to stay. Excellent value for money. Wonderful staff. What more can you ask for. We were on a room only stay so didn't use the main breakfast room. Instead we went to Cafe Aroma. Lovely cooked breakfast for only £7. Good coffee and Virgin Mary's. All served up by the most attentive staff ever. The Spa/Pool/Sauna area is a must. One of the best pools I've ever seen. Will be back soon.  ,5
Spent a long weekend here with friends and do not have a bad thing to say about this wonderful hotel. The decor and facilities are excellent and the staff are efficient and friendly. The breakfasts aew excellent with locally sourced produce and an absolute bargain at a mere £8. The rooms were spotless and comfortable and the bathrooms were well equipped. The pool complex is absolutely amazing and totally worldclass. We will definitely be staying here again soon.,5
"Excellent hotel, well equipped and large bedroom, comfortable and large bathroom (spa-room). Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast and meals in the restaurants absolutely excellent, but we missed jersey wine on the wine card. Wonderful view from the large balcony over St.Hellier up to Elisabeth castle. Inside pool and garden are well-tended. The Hotel de France is very recommendable.",5
"I have often stayed here on business, and always had a wonderful stay, this time we came for a girlie weekend away, and we were not disappointed, the weather was great so while by the pool we could sunbath at the same time.  We ate in Saffrons on the Saturday night, and went for the Degustation Menu, it was fantastic, each course was explained to us, beautifully presented and all I can say is what a taste explosion, a must when I return.  All the staff are friendly and helpful, can't wait to go back.",5
"I stay at the Hotel de France on business approximately twice a year, though this is often in winter. I took the opportunity of extending a business trip and bringing my wife for a long weekend. We received the same excellent service that I usually get. I am always impressed by the helpful attitude of the staff. This time we ate in the Saffron restaurant - exceptional! I am used to excellent Indian food but this is of a different nature and I recommend anyone who likes good food or Asian food to try. The superb weather also helped.",5
"Beautiful, immaculate, spacious and calm hotel. The staff were charming, nothing was too much trouble. We were travelling with an elderly wheelchair user and concerned the hotel would work - it did. They had a lovely spa room with walk in shower which suited their requirements and although we had a standard double at the back of the hotel, it was immaculate and very comfortable. Free onsite parking and disabled spaces at the front door, made life very easy for us. The terrace restaurant was so good and pleasant to sit out on, we ate there every night! I cannot fault this hotel and the customer service was second to none. The facilities are exceptionally good and it is a lovely location. Cannot wait to go back again. Well done Hotel De France.",5
"From arrival to departure the whole experience at the Hotel was outstanding thanks to the high standards set for service, professional and helpful staff and immaculate presentation and cleanliness of the Hotel. Only 10 minutes walk to the town or free courtesy mini-bus available to take you at specific times. Would recommend to anyone that appreciates this high standard of accommodation whether for a business or pleasure trip; looking forward to the next time.",5
"We have just arrived home after our sixth visit to Hotel de France. The hotel itself looks impressive on arrival, with an excellent Spa and pool. Every member of the hotel team was helpfull - especially the young guy who drove the complimentary bus service into town - gave us lots of tips for when we went horse racing at St.Ouen.  The buffet breakfast was superb - plus menu extras. ie. kippers porridge etc. We stayed in the Spa Wing - the room was spacious and relaxing with a fantastic bathroom. Planning another trip in September and will be staying at the Hotel de France - many thanks to Laura for arranging our stay.",5
The hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in. From the moment you enter to the moment you leave you felt that you we special. The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. We had the most fantastic week in Jersey and the hotel made it all the more special.,5
"Every single member of staff we met was incredibly professional and helpful. Whole hotel is stunning and huge open spaces make you nice and relaxed. Spa is great and so are the two restaurants on site.  Great placement, especially if you have a car and there is plenty of free parking",5
I used this hotel for my business trip and had a very nice time.  Service was very good and I'd be happy to go back there again sometime.  I recommend this to anyone traveling to Jersey for business or pleasure.,4
From checking in to checking out the staff made my stay really enjoyable. The food on the terrace  was tasty and the coffee served with a special biscuit was also  really nice. I cannot fault this hotel and I hope t stay there again try soon. Thank you.,5
"I always receive a very friendly welcome, the  customer service is impeccable in the spa, reception  and the restaurant area. i had to change rooms half way through my stay although i new this when i booked due to availability they where both beautiful, clean modern and with all amenities.  I ordered room service that was very quick and came piping hot and beautifully cooked. i always stay here when on business in Jersey because it is good value for money, car parking facilities and very well positions if you wish to walk into town its only a short stroll. Cannot recommend it enough.",5
"We travel to Jersey 3 or 4 times a year on business and pleasure and have stayed at the Hotel De France before as it offers a convenient location with excellent facilities. We book a corporate rate via the local businesses in St Helier and have previously stayed in the west wing where the rooms have adequate space for working. Unknown to us the wing closed in March (we booked in February and were not advised of this) and we were shown to a standard double room in the main hotel. The room was very small, the bed really uncomfortable and the walls so thin that we could hear every conversation next door. Not really what you want when you have to prepare presentations for the following day. After one night we spoke to the reception team and they were very quick to rectify the…",4
"Upon on my arrival I was nicely greeted by staff. They had managed to have my room ready, I wished for early arrival.  I took elevator up, though have to say elevator ride was bit jojo, being old elevator. Room was very nice modern view to neighbouring garage, or over it more. TV was bit small, but who comes to vacation to watch TV? Bathroom amenities (lotion, shampoo and soap) were very good ones, not small but bigger pump models attached to the wall. Bed was very comfortable. Hotel is located uphill, bit off from downtown, close to small Jersey stadium. They have courtesy minibus running to downtown, which is still within walkable distance.",4
"Unfortunately I arrived late and had to shoot out to dinner with client, therefore didn't really get a chance to see more of the hotel. However what I did see and experience was first class and great value. Will definitely stay here again and hopefully see more next time. Excellent breakfast.",5
"We were part of a large group of people who went to Jersey for the Motoring Festival.  Our room and bathroom were of a good size, quiet  and we had an excellent view.  The food was good, especially the buffet breakfast.  The garden and terrace are very relaxing, especially after a long day driving around the island.  We found the staff to be superb, friendly and very attentive, nothing was too much trouble.  They are without doubt a real asset to the hotel.  The wifi works well.  When we left we felt quite relaxed, although we had been busy for the 4 days. We did not use the spa as we had little time, perhaps on our next visit. Would we go back again? definitely!  Our",4
"Just back from jersey and what great hotel this is, the breakfast is to die for, rooms a bit small , the spa is very good, the staff where very polite but need to relex a bit more . I would stay here again.",4
"This really is a Hotel existing in two worlds each with their own character.  The original Building and the Spa Rooms.  The Public Rooms in the original building are beautifully appointed to the extent of being luxurious, and the outside Terraces are places to while away time whilst relaxing in the sunshine with a drink or something to eat.  No quibble either with the food or the Staff who were always helpful and pleasant.  We stayed in a Spa Room which was large, had a balcony and a great view over St. Hellier, but the design of the interior could have been improved.  The TV was small by today's standards, was positioned between windows opening out to the balcony, and was difficult to see from the bed which was set at an angle.  The room lacked subtle lighting and looked like…",4
"A lovely hotel with views out across the bay. The staff are superb and really make this a good hotel. Nice spa & pool facilities too. All-in-all thoroughly recommended.  We stayed in a standard room this time around - nicely done with a view of the sea but not a huge room. It had an interconnecting door with, unfortunately, a very loud snoring neighbour! To the hotel's credit, without us asking they upgraded us after two nights of disturbed sleep to a spa room, which is enormous and I would say is well worth the extra money to get the extra room and huge windows/doors looking out towards the sea.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and when we come back to Jersey again (I am sure there will be another trip back!) we will no doubt stay here again (and definitely pay for the larger…",5
"Fabulous hotel, staff and food. It was very friendly and professional - we will be back and are confident that we will receive the same high level of service! Beautiful pool, lovely spacious rooms especially those with spa facilities. From a group Morgan leader.",5
I found the hotel very clean and well kept. The staff where polite but I felt could do with relaxing and being a little more friendly. It was all a little too rehearsed. The wifi worked very well ( essential to me ) and the food was good.  I would definitly stay here again but wouldn't rush back.,4
"The rooms were not large, but were adequate and very clean. What made this stay so good was the staff who were delightful, could not do enough to help, but were still unobtrusive. The food at this hotel was also exceptional, the Saffron restaurant has to be tried and the breakfast buffet as good as any other I have visited. The spa is also worth a visit with the pool and gardens also very well kept, would definitely go again!",5
"Just back from Hotel de France. We only had the standard room, but with a view over St Helier it was great. The restaurants, bars, pools and gardens were all really good, and the staff were really friendly and helpful. We want to go back!",5
"Family of four stayed here for four nights at end May 2014. We requested rooms near each other before we came, we were pleased to be allocated interconnecting rooms. Beautiful hotel situated 10 minutes walk from main shopping area and restaurants; clean, well decorated and maintained, staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast fantastic, we had great views of the garden from our room. Saunas and pools best we have experienced in a hotel, lots of room never feels busy or crowded. Would stay here again.",5
"I have been visiting this hotel for over 30 years since a long weekend to see visit this island that was the backdrop to the TV series Bergerac.I have therefore seen in in its many incarnations as building/rebuilding has caused it to change greatly during that time.  Throughout it all the one thing that has not changed is the friendly, efficiency of the staff. If something isn't right they will always try to sort it. I don't make use of the exotic spa as I get all my exercise walking on the island. Similarly  I like to visit the great range of restaurants in the town but do usually use the Cafe Aroma in the hotel as well and breakfasts are great. One thing to point out is the short climb from the road up the steep hill on which the hotel is situated. Some visitors will find…",4
"We stayed for two nights and found the room to be spacious, clean and adequate. I must admit, I was expecting slightly more glamorous based on the photos of the hotel but there was nothing to complain about. Our room (152) overlooked nothing in particular which was a shame. The breakfast was great, the spa was really great, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the break didn't cost us a fortune so all good.",4
"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much. Our original room was rather small with a small double bed but, after one very uncomfortable night, we were moved to another standard room which was extremely spacious and had a massive bed! The spa was very nice but the treatments very expensive. However, the massage pool was wonderful! The food was unusual...Indian themed Restuarant served high quality food but not to everyone's taste. It was also ver expensive. We indulged in Afternoon Tea which was superb!! So much food we couldn't eat it all!  Overall, we would return to this hotel again if we could be given one of the larger bedrooms.",4
The Hotel De France never disappoints and always surprises. Such a wonderful place since the spa has been upgraded it's even better. Simply a must for visitors to Jersey. The food is amazing with great menu choices and several different places to eat within the hotel.,5
"I stayed this weekend with my husband and small child, we had a family room which (while perfectly clean, quiet and adequate), looked like a throwback from years gone by.  Given the website look and feel and the cost of the room I expected more.  That said, the waiting staff in Aroma Cafe were second to none with one of the waiters, John, being jovial with our 4 year old and making her feel special.  Our food was fantastic too & I would head back there for that alone.  Again the staff in Saffrons bar were charming and attentive and were happy to accommodate us making an alcho-free cocktail for our daughter. The pool area is fantastic & gives a luxury feel - again, well worth going for this.  I would go again, but this time I wouldn't expect so much from the rooms.",4
"Comfortable quiet room at the back of the hotel. Free wifi good signal. Buffet style breakfast was super; tasty fresh wide selection continental and traditional English too.  As much as you like.   Swimming pool area although inside is bright modern and fresh. Two pools plus sauna and steam room.   Staff friendly and helpful  Like much of Jersey it's very quiet on a Sunday eg no courtesy bus into town and one of the two restaurants isn't open. The hotel is not in the centre of town, bear in mind if you don't have transport. ",5
"Staff are very helpful, food is excellent if a little expensive,  free parking and wi fi.  The breakfast is excellent and they offer a fulll range including kippers and porrage.  The pool is just OK, it could be bigger and has a closed in feel to it.",5
"We stayed here over May bank holiday. Incredibly attentive staff, great dinner in the bistro, and pleasant evening afterwards in the bar area, which is very relaxing. The spa facilities, including pool, are absolutely lovely. Location is very good with just a short stroll into the town where there is a good variety of shops and restaurants. We will definitely be going back.  The rooms are very clean and a good size, perhaps a little dated in terms of decor but by no means does this spoil the overall experience of the hotel.",4
As ever the hotel experience is excellent.  The service is excellent and the food in the Bistro is excellent and good value.  The rooms are clean and tidy with good wifi connection. The only down side is the lack of curtains. I didn't use the Spa on this trip.,4
"Stayed here during April 2014, Nice room on the third floor, good English fresh cooked breakfast. Very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms lack a little sound proofing but kept clean and tidy. Did not get to use the facilites but looked very modern.",4
"Beautiful hotel from the outside, stunning interior and reception area. Great staff, very helpful, special mention to Marco. Room was nice but no curtains only white vertical blinds that didn't close all the way up. Hot water took forever to get to the taps/shower. The evening meal was wonderful and the service was outstanding. The morning came a lot quicker than I was expecting due to the sun bursting into the room at sunrise (545am). Oh well that gave me time to get a shower etc before the pre order breakfast in bed arrived at 7.30. At 7.45 I was a bit hungry and opened the door fully expecting to find my tray on the floor at the door, alas no. The breakfast order was still hanging on the door handle from the night before. I walked down to reception to complain, ""we don't know…",2
"Just returned from a two night business/pleasure trip to Jersey. On arrival at the hotel I quizzed the friendly desk staff about local restaurants: They recommended one that I had seen, and immediately called and reserved a table for myself and my partner. Lovely old-fashioned ambience about the building, great service and very good breakfast. we did have to move rooms as ours had an adjoining door which meant absolutely no soundproofing, but this was done with a minimum of fuss. Huge beds. Generally first class all around. It's an old building, and it shows, but if you want to stay in a soul-less Premier Inn or similar then go there. Otherwise for a bit of class and character then the Hotel De France is the one..",5
"Have visited the hotel many times and stayed recently to see how different the place is after the recent Christmas refurb closure. I know they planed to convert one of the wings to apartments and was interested to see the changes. Besides the smell of fresh paint in my room I couldn't see any! The hotel is still ok and it's true it trumps a lot of the others with car parking and it's spa facility,especially if the weather is nice. This is a massive hotel and must be doing some very careful balancing of the books to keep it all going. I hope everything goes well for them but for me I think   It needs to be brought up to date or is likely to be stuck in a rut. ",4
"Stayed at Hotel de France over Easter weekend, the hotel was tucked away situated behind a medical centre & a reasonable walk to the town although would imagine a long walk for some. The hotel was very clean, the room was good with good facilities although we were at the back of the hotel so no views. The staff were ok but not the friendliest I've ever met. The food was very good although the Saffron restaurant was closed some nights which surprised us over a bank holiday weekend. The Spa was very good, the staff were very helpful & the treatments on offer were good. Overall very good & would recommend.",4
"Based 10/15 minutes from the centre of St Helier, the Hotel de France has a perfect location for exploring Jersey. The hotel's public areas were smart and well tended. The staff on the front desk were both friendly and helpful. There are two restaurants; one a brasserie and one a proper restaurant (Saffron's with a menu filled with good international fare). That said there are 4 Michelin starred restaurants on Jersey (with great value lunch offers), so we did not eat in the hotel often. I would not like to pass too much of a comment on the rooms; as we choose cheap and cheerful singles. They were clean though and with all the facilities (TV, bath, shower, free Wifi) that we required. The spa area is outstanding and of a very high quality. It would not look out of place in any 5…",4
"There have been a few less-than-complimentary reviews for this hotel but I think they're unfair. Yes, some things are a bit dated but we found the staff very pleasant, the room clean and the breakfast was pretty good for a buffet; a lot of choice and good quality.   But the star was the spa centre. Everything here was excellent. I'd have liked a hot tub but the jet pool was a first for me and I loved it. We also splashed out on some massages and here, the whole experience was wonderful, with even a kind of post-massage relaxation room where they give you a herbal tea and wrap you in a blanket rather than chasing you out the door. I got a £40 upper-body, neck massage and a £40 Indian head massage which which took about an hour and was well worth it.  The main thing about our stay…",4
Just got back from 3 night stay. Think although spacious it was pretty average. Friendly reception staff. However .... Had a couple of pairs of worn underwear disappear from case in my room and felt a little embarrassed to report!!!,3
5th April-12th April Returned to Jersey for our 29th wedding anniversary. Stayed at this hotel for the first time and loved it.Stayed on B&B the breakfast was super with plenty of choice. The room overlooked the town of St.Helier was very well maintained and clean. The Spa area was also first class and my wife enjoyed the steam room! We ate in the cafe aroma three times and the quality of food was very good. Would certainly return to this hotel!,4
"This trip was a Christmas present from my OH, excited as I stayed there as a child and wondered how much I would remember. The only real memory I had was of sitting at the bedroom window eating my tea and looking out at the view. The room we were given was tiny with a very small window looking out at nothing. It had a sloping ceiling and a dining chair either side of the bed facing towards the bed. When he complained he was shown two other rooms one he declared was worse and the other although slightly larger had an even worse view,if that was possible. When we went back to reception they offered us one of the spa rooms at a supplement. In the end we agreed to pay as we weren't prepared to stay in the other rooms.  We were annoyed that we had been put in the uncomfortable…",3
"It is the friendliness of the staff that makes this a pleasant place to stay. The rooms are dated but immaculately clean. The compensation for being a good 15 min walk from town is that you get a fans attic view over St Helier. The spa is lovely and cafe great for lunch. Overall, the hotel could do with updating and the walls are very thin which makes it fairly noisy at times. Chris",3
My wife and myself decided to treat ourselves again to stay in this marvellous hotel. It is set a little way from town but you can use the free shuttle bus if you do not drive and there is also a bus stop outside the hotel. There have been modernisation works carried out and we understand these will continue over time but will not affect your stay. We were given an upgrade to a Spa Room which was fantastic. The staff are very helpful and friendly and there are two great restaurants available plus bar if you do not fancy going out. We would definitely go back again.,5
"My girlfriend and I checked into the Hotel de France for an overnight stay for valentines night, and it was simply excellent. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who were quick to give us our room key and advise us on the hotel's facilities. Our room was well appointed and the very clean, the bed was comfortable and we were delighted.  The restaurant bar was managed by a delightful Russian lady who couldn't do enough to make us comfortable. We also went down to the spa in the morning for a swim and sauna/steam which was fantastic. The spa is gorgeous and the gymnasium is well equipped. Just what you need!!. The food is great and the grounds are beautiful and quiet. All in all excellent.",5
"Yes, as last reviewer said, hotel was quiet, but it's January and the weather is cold and wet, but the hotel is warm, comfortable, staff are welcoming and friendly. The spa is excellent, fantastic pools, steam room and sauna, with places to sit and chill out, which we made use of on wet afternoons. The gym is well equipped, air conditioned and up to date.  Our spa room was large, warm, a nice comfy bed and bathroom with shower and bath.   The included breakfast was lovely, and if we wanted a full cooked English we just had to ask. Would definitely stay here again",4
"Stayed for one night with a car, we were given room 308 which was right by the lift. The hotel was deserted, we didn't even see another guest during our time here. The bedroom was small, bathroom incredibly dated and the pipes were noisy when toilet was flushed and shower used. We felt incredibly ripped off as we paid £76 room only! We checked out early and headed to the car to see a rude note left on my windscreen about the carpark being for guests. I headed back to the hotel to complain as I had written down the registration upon check in. No apology from the girl at reception, she just took the notice and said it was fine. That isn't the point. It's unprofessional. Could have stayed at the radisson for £4 more and had breakfast! I do recommend that you do this, funnily enough…",3
"I stayed at this hotel for a recent business trip to the area in Janaury. Check in was very efficient and I was given a room on the second floor facing the rear which does provide a particular nice view. The room was small and very warm on entering but was very comfortable and offered homely facilities.  Breakfast is offered both as a buffet and a la cart dinning, I found the quality of food and service to be excellent. In addition we made use of the business facilities which are excellent and the hotel overall offers excellent WIFI.  A very enjoyable stay.",4
"I recently stayed here for a couple of nights whilst on a business trip to Jersey. The Hotel and the Room were warm, cosy, clean, and comfortable. The bed was soft and comfortable and the general appearance of the establishment is one of being looking after. The staff were courteous and on hand to assist where needed. If ever visiting Jersey in the future I would certainly stay at this hotel again.",5
"Loved the large Spa Room with balcony and view over St. Helier. Walk-in rain shower. Large choice for breakfast - nice to have Jersey Cabbage Bread on offer every day. Room was clean and room service was good. We ate on the terrace one evening and the food was excellent, although with such a wide choice on Jersey we were out every other night! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5
"Food excellent, service first class.    Downside was the steep climb back into the hotel via the medical centre, but that can't be helped.   Swimming pool tremendous, sauna and steam room v ery good  Jersey and indee the hotel is ideal for the long week end or the Monday to Friday break but it's limitations especially in times of poor weather does not indexer itself to a week or two break length",4
"Have stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed every minute. The room was well equipped with kettle and trouser press and was also well heated and ventilated. Staff were all hard working, polite and friendly. The pool(s) were the best I've seen and were clean and well maintained. There was always plenty of choices at breakfast and always freshly prepared fruit and Jersey yoghurts. A courtesy bus runs frequently to town or it is a 10 min walk.",5
"The only thing this hotel lacked to make it weirder was a telepathic six-year old boy riding around the corridors on a tricycle, We really did not enjoy our stay here at all. We stayed in the new wing and whilst the rooms were huge there was little in the way of soft furnishings, pictures or mirrors to make them warmer or friendlier, floor to ceiling windows one of which opened out to a balcony but with an office style roller blind as opposed to curtains. The whole hotel was freezing as for some extraordinary reason the powers that be decided that the air conditioning should be on cool (in early November) when we complained we were told that it was ""centrally controlled"" and only went to warm when the temperature dropped to a certain point (presumably the freezing point of…",2
My sister and I stayed here for 5 days and were very impressed . Our room was on the eighth floor and the view was fab. The food was superb as was the service from all the staff. A great hotel with brilliant leisure facilities too. Will definitely return. Well done Hotel de France!,5
"We stayed here on a short September break.  The hotel is a good 10 min walk from the town and front which is why 4 stars not 5.  The room was a good size and very comfortable.We chose to eat every night in the Aroma restaurant.  The selection was very good and the food was excellent. You cannot book this restaurant but we found 7pm quite easy to get a table.  It does get very busy later. There is a first class spa which was free to use,with changing facilities and sauna,steam rooms and showers. On a fine day there is a large terrace near to the gardens and pool. Drinks are served day and night.",4
"We've been to Jersey many times but for so e reason this hotel was off my radar. Had a good deal from a late booking site so decided to go for it. My first impression wasn't good and I was disappointed that the hotel was just behind St Helier and in a built up area. I should have done my homework better and looked at the location especially as I was booking for friends as well so felt responsible. The hotel looked huge, which it was but after managing to get a space in the small car park we checked in and I started to feel a bit better. The reception area was spacious and welcoming. The hotel gave a much better impression inside and was on the luxurious side. Rooms were spacious with a view across the rooftops to St Helier and also down into the gardens. Although not vast, the…",4
"The spa room with walk-in shower, lots of space, and a great view of St Helier was outstanding and good value. The hotel is is little way out of town, but that's not a problem. The pool and spa facilities are really excellent, the pool especially is one of the best indoor pools I've used. All in all, a great experience, with friendly staff, good breakfast, everything one could wish for.",5
"Stayed here recently on business in a single room. The first thing to say, is that the hotel is massive, plenty of space for decent sized rooms, however thats not the case for a business single! The welcome was friendly, it seemed a quiet day, but that didnt detract from a big smile and the door being held open for me. Check in was fine professional and courteous. Got to the rokm  and was greeted by an odd shaped room, that you couldnt swing a cat in(not that i had a cat), and with a tiny tv of which the buttons on the remote were worn out and didnt work hardly. Called down for an iron and got it elibvered to my room promptly. Tea and coffee facilities/ shower/ towels and bed, all good, and as you would expect. Didnt go to the gym/ pool, but they look great. Bar was nice, (there…",4
"What a lovely hotel. On arrival we were a little disappointed as we felt the bedrooms lacked character, and would agree that lack of a room safe is disadvantage. However, for comfort, service and excellent facilities it would be hard to beat. The breakfasts were great with plenty of choice, and the food in Saffrons restaurant was excellent. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The pool area was excellent too. The decor may be a bit dated but the hotel is well maintained and certainly not shabby. We spent some time in some of the funkier hotels, but found the service in those paled compared to the Hotel de France.",5
"Very small single room, TV not much bigger than my iPad.  Felt welcome was flat and was concerned about giving my PIN number as well as credit card details even though I had paid in full. A good 15 minute walk to town, though I was given a map.  Yet to try spa but no information given.  No information in room about meal times, check in / out times etc.  felt as a single traveller that I was irrelevant..  Very disappointed, does not live up to its advertising.",2
"I stayed here on business for the week, the hotel is nice but I found it to be very dated, in need of upgrading, especially the shower. The food is good, I had a 3 course Indian meal for £18 on Thursday and the food was excellent.  Staff were always friendly and they had excellent wifi. I would stay here again on business but it's not a hotel I'd choose for my own personal taste, slightly too dated for me.",4
Just arrived at Hotel de France. Supposed to be a 4 star hotel. No safe in the room. Have to go to reception to put jewellery and passports  into a safe round the back. How ridiculous and inconvenient especially as room is on the 9th floor and at the end of a corridor. Also asked for room with a view and got one overlooking a huge blue roof with the sea miles in the background that you can see if you happen to have a pair of binoculars handy. Smacks of Faulty Towers. ,2
"I stayed here on business for one night as I was presenting at a major local conference for the island's many accountants. It is an ok hotel but nothing special. Very business focused with good conference facilities but personally it wouldn't be the kind of place I would choose to stay at when on vacation. In fact, even as a business hotel it isn't great. My room was a decent size but it was rather bland and felt a little dated. I'd expect a bit more character in what is a historic property dating from the mid 19th century. Some may be interested to know that the TV in my room was tiny though personally I didn't use it. The lack of an in room iron & iron board is disappointing when you need a well pressed shirt ahead of your big presentation. Having to get one delivered from…",3
"This was not the hotel standard we were expecting. It advertises itself as a four star hotel I would suggest the standard of other four star hotels in Jersey is far higher. This is not a hotel for the person wanting just a holiday the focus of it is based upon the corporate market, conferences and business clients.  We booked 13 nights at the hotel and when we enquired about the room we would be allocated. We were informed they were unable to tell us as rooms are allocated the day before arrival. We told staff we wanted a room with a view but not of a wall, and we needed a fridge in the room to put medication in. We were assured that as we were staying for a reasonable period of time our request would be met. The day before arrival we were told the room had been allocated and we…",2
"Would recommend the hotel and spa. The staff were very polite and helpful. The facilities were good. However our break was ruined by the rudeness of the lady in the salon whose attitude was far from inviting and her claim that there was ""a three month waiting list"" left us somewhat confused as to why this facility would be advertised for hotel guests. ",3
"This was the second time we have stayed, a repeat visit of 5 nights because of the wonderful experience we had with a week in July 2013. All of the staff give truly excellent service, polite, helpful, and made the stay a very pleasant one to such an extent we will probably be coming back next year. The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere, excellent food both at breakfast and the evening meal (we had a half board package). It was a little noisy one night when there appeared to be a party on the outside patio, we did mention this & the hotel did say they would review how they manage this in future.",5
"I tried to book two adjoining rooms today for myself, partner and three children. The adjoining rooms at this hotel only accommodate the standard 2 adults and 2 children and none of the rooms are large enough to fit in an extra bed. This seems a bit silly to me and something the hotel should look to provide. I asked the lady on reservations ""so what do families with three children do?"" and she replied ""I have no idea"" (and clearly didn't care). So I guess we'll take our business to a hotel that does care and can accommodate our needs...",1
"Booked this as a surprise and a treat for my partner and I, flew over from Exeter which was great just a half hour flight.  Everything about this hotel was wonderful, the staff were terrific, so polite, helpful and courteous.   We had a standard room which was more than adequate for our needs, comfortable and clean. We had room 906 which was high up, beware if you don't like lifts as this one is on the outside of the building so if this is something you aren't keen on then take the stairs.  We had a 55 minute Ayush massage in the Ayush wellness spa as part of the package it was simply divine - I will review this separately, but if you need a spot of pampering then you won't get much better than this!   We ate in the cafe aroma restaurant, again very polite and attentive staff…",5
"I stayed for two nights at a conference . The conference facilities were excellent . Very impressed with all the rooms.  Lunch was a let down , not enough and poorly labelled , so you had no idea what you were eating. My bedroom was a good size but it lacked air conditioning and therefore was unbearably hot. Reception , restaurant and bar staff were lovely . ",3
"Have just returned from a three night break at Hotel de France and was very impressed.  Excellent value, excellent service, immaculately clean and maintained to the highest standards.  The hotel was very calm and peaceful, being just above St Helier,  and the minibus shuttle down to the town was a nice touch.  We ate at Cafe Aroma and the portion sizes were most generous, the service (lovely waitress, Jena) was perfect and the only regret was that we didn't have room for the desserts :(  We will know next time!   On our other two nights, we wanted to explore Jersey - but be careful.  The reputation of some restaurants in St Helier is overrated and with hindsight we would have been better off trying Saffron as well as Cafe Aroma.  The spa was, as fisheatingveggie said, ""the best…",5
Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. We then made our way up to our room which was beautiful and very spacious. After getting settled we then got ready and went to the spa to chill out and when we got down there we were again greeted by very friendly staff and a beautiful swimming pool. We also had a treatment of a full body massage which was absolutely lovely and very relaxing. We decided to have dinner in the hotel and it was delicious as was the breakfast and there was so much choice. I would like to thank the hotel for my lovely trip away because i didn't want to leave!!!,5
We have very much enjoyed our stay here again. The spa rooms are particularly fabulous and the swimming pool/jacuzzi etc the best of any hotel. Great choice at breakfast although would prefer pots of tea. Cafe Aroma very stylish for evening meal and Saffrons bar restaurant has great food but a dress code might help retain the quiet drink image to whch it aspires. About 20 minute walk into town or minibus Mon-Sat. ,4
"Our Aurigny flight to Guernsey from Gatwick  yesterday evening had to divert to Jersey as thick fog in Guernsey prevented our being able to land there. Aurigny crew sprang into action as it became clear that the weather was not going to improve, and  with Jersey ground staff sorted out overnight accommodation for the 60+. passengers at the Hotel de France. Coaches were speedily dispatched to transfer us to the hotel; upon arrival we were checked in by pleasant, cheerful staff and informed that dinner was available for us all in the Orangery  (courtesy Aurigny who also picked up the hotel tab). We were informed that the coaches would pick us up at 7.30am to return us to the airport, 60+ of us sat down and had a very tasty two course dinner served by efficient friendly staff. I…",4
"Having got a deal for one night, we were OK with a room without a view.  The room was a good size and clean; parking was easy and the food & service in the Bistro was excellent.  The location was handy for the ferry port and our early checkout was smooth.",4
"When we arrived at this hotel in our rental car, I went inside to find someone to help with our luggage and was immediately impressed with the very elegant and spacious foyer, which unlike some four stars built in the 1860's had been immaculately maintained. This we were to discover applied to all the common areas throughout the property.  The receptionist could not have been no helpful and a porter was immediately located. He took charge of our cases and directed us to the covered car park which is immediately next to the hotel.  On checking in, we asked if a room was available with a safe, one was in the newest part of the hotel at an additional charge of £50 per day.  We were then given the choice of our standard room as booked, or the upgrade to the spa wing.  We were then…",5
"The hotel is located a short walk from St Helier. Parking, as with anywhere in St Helier, is very tight, and I ended up in the medical centre about 200 yds from the hotel. I was lucky - it was the last space. I think next time I will get taxis ! The hotel is tucked behind the medical centre which is a bit of an eyesore. However, the hotel is lovely and is done in a French chateau style. Check in was swift and efficient. My single room booked on booking.com was very clean and really quiet, which I really appreciated. The free wi-fi was very fast and enabled me to work during the evening. I ate in the Brasserie (Aroma I think - anyway the one near the spa area). It was very busy and bustling with a good atmosphere. Service and food were excellent and reasonably priced. Breakfast…",5
The previous review that says to choose your room carefully could not have been more accurate. We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the hotel and although we had a lovely time I feel the need to write this review about the issues we had especially with the rooms. The hotel photos on the internet look amazing but when you arrive this hotel is hidden behind a monstrosity of a building which is such a shame. The reception area restores your faith that the hotel will be lovely but the bedrooms then let you down again. This was a belated honeymoon with our 15 month old daughter. Having been to Jersey loads of times we decided to stay near St Helier in order to walk into town for dinner every evening. Having booked our room I decided to call the reservation line to ask for an…,4
"The hotel was really good.  Service good, staff friendly, food at both Restaurants good quality. Not much bad to say about this one and glad I chose it! Close enough to St Helier, about a 10 minute walk, I am fit so it was the best way for me. Enough to keep me occupied.  I like travelling alone so this suited me fine apart from the weather on a couple of the days. The Spa was amazing and I treated myself to a treatment which was wonderful! Gym facilities better than most places I have stayed and the pool was great! Achieved what I wanted and would definitely recommend this one.",4
"Lovely hotel, just what  we wanted. Good size rooms lovely view over the town ad bay. Breakfast is great, wonderful choice. Staff all pleasant. Good food in the bars too. Spa is great, lovely pool ad sauna etc.  the only downside was the weather, which was cloud and rain most days, but even the weather could not spoil a lovely week. Free parking too at the hotel.",5
Arrived in Jersey ready for the air show and went straight to the hotel.The room was not ready as we were very early but the staff were very helpful and kept us up to date with the room. we choice the spa room as they have large doors leading to a well appointed balcony.the view is breath taking.all the food and service is the best not sure why it isnt 5* made us of the free shuttle bus down into town.one of the best holidays ever in every respect,5
"My wife and I spent 4 delightful days here, (10th-14th september). When we arrived we were warmly greeted, by the receptionist who went on to explain the various places we should visit and the many facilities the Hotel had to offer Spa, Swimming pool etc. the staff were always very professional ,helpful and courteous . I would highly recommend this hotel . The 3 restuarants offer a splendid selection for all tastes and budgets.",5
"If you enjoy a great spa experience, then this is the location for you. Very nice staff, good food, rooms ok but not great, overall a very enjoyable hotel. There is a courtesy bus into town 5 times per day also.",4
"The hotel is in a great location, literally just a 5 minute walk from the delights of St Helier. The staff are very friendly and international. I was very pleased by the spa and fitness center as well, you can use them both as much as you like and they are open until quite late. The breakfast was good and there was a lot of choice. On busy weekends you may have to wait a little while to be seated and for any cooked to order food but other than that it was rather satisfactory. The rooms are big enough, and the decor is quite traditional but not quite yet outdated. Overall a great stay.",4
"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights (3 to 7 Sep) on a short break.  The room (No 124) was clean, airy and comfortable and had a lovely view over the terrace and towards St Helier.  The hotel was beautifully furnished, with a wonderful staircase in reception.  The breakfast was excellent with loads of choice and was taken in the Orangery.  We ate three nights out of the four at Cafe Aroma, twice on the terrace and once inside.  The meals were really tasteful and there was a great choice.  As 77nab commented, the staff were absolutely terrific and were a credit to the hotel.  We will be back as we found 5 days was not enough to see all of Jersey.  All in all a wonderful hotel.",5
"Every single member of staff encountered during my staff was excellent, cheerful, friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Other hotels could learn from your staff. Would be good to warn guests that lifts up to rooms are glass and on outside of building. Being terrible with heights this was a shock!",5
This is one of the fanciest and most expensive hotels on Jersey. I used to live on Jersey and recentoy went back to see mates for my birthday with my bf. We stayed here for a week and enjoyed the poshness! However I was dissapointed with the aircon as it was a very hot week in Jersey and we boiled in the room with the windows open and vad aircon in full blast! Apart from that we had a great time. There is even a hotel bus that will take you into town. The staff were really happy and freindly too.,4
"We booked a 10 night stay at this hotel at short notice after our planned holiday feel through and so didn't really know what to expect.. The staff were friendly an helpful during our whole stay. The food is excellent with a choice of three restaurants where the service too was excellent. Our room was clean, comfortable and airy. The hotel is about 10 to 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The walk is not difficult except for the last part where there are a number of steps which may be difficult for those with mobility problems. However a mini bus does run a shuttle service to and from the centre of St Helier and this drops you at the front door. If you are in a car the Hotel is on the Ring Road which is a bonus and there is ample parking available. A perfect base from which to…",5
I recently transferred here from the Samares Coast hotel for 2nights. I booked a single room without breakfast for £130. Very good value for money. I have stayed here several times before with my partner and it is still very good. It's not a bucket and spade family hotel which but is perfect for couples and business travellers. It's quiet and a 10 minute walk from the town centre with plenty of parking. I did find the receptionist a tad surly on check in but perhaps she was just having a bad hair day. Altogether a quality hotel that I will be happy to visit again.,4
"A wonderful week celebrating a 60th birthday and 40th wedding anniversary made special by a lovely room, friendly staff and excellent food. A standard room was all that was available on booking but the travel agent asked if we could be allocated a superior room should one become available. The hotel actually took notice of this and we were upgraded to a lovely spacious room wih a view facing the town(254). Champagne and fruit was left in our room on the day of our anniversary- a lovely gesture we wont forget. We had planned to go in to town for our evening meals but after sampling the excellent food in Cafe Aroma served by the most friendly efficient staff we ate in the hotel  every night. The spa area is also very nice. We spent a lot of time relaxing in the garden. I asked a…",5
"Wow, what an amazing hotel in a beautiful part of the world.We booked a three night offer through secret escapes which included ferry crossing ,car hire ,breakfast and a three course meal on the evening of arrival for quite a reasonable price so to be honest my expectations weren't very high. I WAS VERY MISTAKEN! We arrived at the hotel which from the outside looks very grand  we were then shown to our room which was clean and comfortable and had views across the city. The hotel is located just outside the centre but within walking distance of the main shopping centre or if not just a short taxi ride. The perfect location and base for exploring the island and also for peace and quiet after a day in the  hustle and bustle of city centre .The staff were always cheerful and…",5
I was expecting more after having stayed at Hotel de France for 3 nights. The room was a standard room and I found it small. The aircon was not too good. The breakfast room I felt a little crowded. The highlight in the breakfast room was the jersey yogurt - was/is very good and well testing. We had dinner one night in the Saffran restaurant. It was an average experience.  Some positive things. The staff  is helpful and nice. The location of this hotel is good and a good starting point to discover the island. The pool area is very nice.,3
"Lovely, quiet base to explore the island from. Our room was in the original building, it was large, tastefully decorate, french doors with a juliette balcony and a reasonable sized clean bathroom. There was only two things that let the room down - a standard size double bed and no dressing gowns. Don't poohoo these, we had a lovely view on the terrace and the terrace had a lovely view of us (there was a least one person on the terrace smoking all the time). There are plenty of lifts and stair cases in the original building.  The swimming pool looked lovely - just didn't have time to use it.  The terraces were a great place to relax and have a drink but because there was so much to explore on the island we didn't do too much relaxing. The food was well cooked and reasonably…",4
"This is a bigger hotel than we usually choose, but there was a good offer and so we booked a three night stay. It's located in the suburbs of St Helier, quite a way from the sea front and shops, but on the other hand some rooms have good views over the city. We had an excellent room: very spacious and light on a corner of an upper floor. We glimpsed a few others that were much smaller. The bathroom was a bit dated but very clean. We found it odd that we had neither a mini bar 'fridge (which we normally use to keep our own stuff cool), nor a room safe. The hotel is, overall, very good quality. Food in the principal restaurants was very good. In fact, we agreed that the degustation meal in the Saffron restaurant (7 courses) was truly excellent. The presentation was superb.…",4
Visited this hotel in 2009 and a return visit recently confirmed that it is still excellent. Of particular note were the staff who were uniformly cheerful and helpful. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in St Helier.,5
"Booked up for a last minute overnight stay to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary as let down by another hotel 30 minutes before check in. When I called, the member of staff was very helpful and we managed to book one of the SPA room with a balcony. Room was fantastic and had lovely view over the town. The bathroom was nice and clean with a lovely big deep bath. We already had reservations for dinner elsewhere so didn't eat at the hotel. Had a few drinks in the lounge before bed and nice and relaxing atmosphere with polite staff. Arrived back at the room and there was a complementary bottle of cava and fruit arrangement left for us. Breakfast was lovely. Unfortunately as we ended up checking in late we were not able to make use of the facilities of the hotel but the pool…",5
"On advice from our travel agent we upgraded to one of the hotel's new spa rooms which are located in a new wing of the hotel. These rooms are beautifully spacious with a large bathroom with walk-in shower in addition to a deep bath. There was also a mini-bar, separate fridge and safe large enough to take a laptop computer. Small balcony overlooking the town - but also the roof of the new health spa which did spoil the view a little. But really that did nothing to spoil our enjoyment during our 5 night stay. We found all the staff courteous and helpful and our room was always clean and tidy when we returned to it. Housekeeping even provided feather pillows on request. Breakfast was good - the only down-side was having to queue to use the toaster. The range of bread was vast but…",5
"The hotel is beautiful with friendly staff. We were able to enter our room on our arrival in the morning, our room over looked the front terrace and lawn, which was lovely. It was very clean and comfortable. The hotel is situated a little far from town but it means a lovely view and a quiet restful lawn to pretend you are in greece on a sun lounger. The walk would take 15 minutes but it is easy to get lost so be careful. The spa area is lovely to relax in. The food in the Saffron resturant is exquisite one of the best meals i have had the pleasure to enjoy with amazing service. Cafe Aroma also has some delicous meals to select from but not so good service. Only negative is walking up a steep slope/steps as the hotel is situated behind a hospital but they do provide a free…",4
"Had to write a review of the restaurant after our recent 3 day stay, as we ate at Saffron's, the Asian themed hotel restaurant, on the first night of our 3 night stay, and my main meal was one of the best I have ever had. All 4 of the courses we managed were very good, but the lobster was simply outstanding - gently spiced, accompanied by red mullet, morels, and scallops. Truly magnificent.",4
"I stayed at the Hotel de France 10 years ago and I don't think the rooms have been touched since my last visit. Really needs updating. However, the room was clean, the bed comfortable and the food good. Some of the staff were not as friendly as they could have been. Could perhaps do with some hospitality training. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it has a nice Health Suite. Be advised that there are no fridges in the rooms and depending on your room you will be woken at about 4.30am up by the pigeons outside your window.",3
"We booked a balcony room for three nights,the balcony was small and when we inquired why we had no table on ours we were told that not all rooms have tables as they sometimes blow away and the guest do not always look after them.We returned to our room at 1500 hrs on the first day to find that it had not been cleaned or the bed made and when we asked why we were told in no uncertain manner that they would get round to us sometime during the day as they were very busy with other rooms.We immediately checked out and moved to another hotel.",2
Just come back from a 4 night break - disappointed with room facilities - no mini bar - basic toiletries - hard beds and pillows.  Breakfast was a frustrating buffet - hard work to get a tea or coffee and then was pretty disgusting - food cold and often waiting for items.  Bars were overpriced and pretentious and entertainment dire.  On a lovely warm evening Cafe Aroma doesn't serve drinks after 10 pm which leaves the lounge bar - seen more life at a funeral and pint and a half £9.10 or Atrium Bar with an accordion player and a cellist playing to 6 people! Spa was lovely and reception staff very friendly and helpful.,3
"the hotel is out of the way and about 20/25 mins walk to the city.It helps to have a car however the one way system can be confusing so perhaps a taxi. Our room was spotless and the bed comfortable .Good bathroom and separate loo. The hotel is very big with plenty of amenities. A spa and all that comes with it and also a hairdresser/ beauty salon .There is a lovely terrace to sit on to soak up the sun ,have a drink or eat.  The food we had which was mostly breakfasts was good and the staff were helpful. The kids club is entertainment for them while you have a swim or treatment . Would use this hotel again but wish it was nearer town",4
"We stay at Hotel de France at least twice per year. The rooms are nice but not spectacular, and if you are at the rear of the hotel there is 'no' view at all, which is a shame. The hotel is generally spacious, and the pool area is brilliant. The Spa is 'epic', and we generally treat ourselves to a couple of treatments.  We've not used the restaurants much in the past as whilst the food is good, the service has typically been poor. However our visit this last weekend the service was 'brilliant' in the hotel restaurant. They seem to have some new staff (inc Management) & this has made a huge difference. So much more convenient to have great evening meals at the hotel.  We'll be back again soon.",4
"I stayed with my mother for 5 nights ,we each had separate rooms and have to say the rooms were very nice. What was noticed on arrival was that when we approached the reception desk the staff diminished to one ,where she turned her back on us, which wasn't very nice. When we checked in,our credit cards were asked for,with the PIN number also ! I found this odd and questioned why she needed the PIN number , after rolling her eyes she said it for additional charges eg.corkage for drinks bought in from outside the hotel and disappearing items in the room ,this made us feel we were not trusted! Once checked in we looked around hotel and the facilities provided and noticed inflated prices in the restaurants where we decided to go and look elsewhere .The location of the hotel was a…",3
"We stayed here for our wedding night.We stayed in a spa room which was very spacious had a very comfortable large bed nice seating area a lovely bathroom with large bath and great shower and a balcony.The hotel was great staff were all friendly and helpful, the spa is really nice lovely pools and sauna/steam room great.The food was lovely fantastic selection all thoroughly enjoyable!!!The hotel looks fantastic and the spa room definitely has the wow factor would definitely recommend!!!",5
"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in August 2013. We stayed in a Spa room which was large and comfortable with a seperate seating area and a balcony. The bathroom was large with a separate bath and walk in shower.  The hotel buliding is grand and looks impressive. There was plenty of parking and a shop selling newspapers, drinks and confectionery in the reception area.  The reception staff were nice but the restaurant staff seemed disinterested with what they were doing at both breakfast time and the one evening meal we had.  The spa is nice and although the pool is not huge, was never busy at anyt time.  Its a nice hotel and id probably stay again if i were wanting to base myself in St Helier.",4
"This was my first stay at the Hotel De France & will not be my last I`ve already booked to go back. The hotel has something for everyone, the facilities are fabulous not only does it have the most amazing spa with infinity pool it also has a shop, a hair salon & an Indian restaurant but a gorgeous outside space & gardens.",5
"Yes there are more luxurious hotels in Jersey but these can often be over-priced and pretentious and without the range of amenities that the Hotel De France offers. The reasons we continue to return to this hotel when visiting Jersey are: it is always clean and excellently maintained, well located centrally for exploring the island, single rooms at good value, staff are helpful and polite, the spa/grounds area is excellent, although a large hotel it never seems crowded, good choice of breakfast. We will certainly continue to use the hotel when visiting Jersey and would recommend to friends (A good sign I feel!).  To improve: better range of spa treatments and king size beds instead of standard doubles.",4
"Having holidayed in Jersey for the past 6 years, we decided to give Hotel De France a try. We were not disappointed. Having read a few reviews on here saying it was dated and too far from the centre, we were a bit concerned, but need not have been. The room was clean and well maintained. Each day the maid would place his teddies on the bed in different poses. Really made his holiday special and funny. We ate in all the restaurants - Café Aroma great bistro food, Saffrons superb tasting menu, Orangery simple but great buffet menu. Bars very comfortable. Brilliant spa facility. Super Kids club and entertainment, especially Royston the Magic Man Walked into St Helier a couple of times, which took approx. 15 mins, but very easy. Would recommend the route through Millenium Park  A…",5
"Last minute booking which turned out to be favourable. Lovely spa facilities. Friendly , helpful staff. Spacious , comfortable and clean room. Plenty of choice at breakfast time. Café Aroma best for lunch or snacks. Plenty of eating places in St. Helier.",4
"Having just booked in for 5 days with my 2 teenage sons, we have been very pleased with the quality and location of the Hotel and facilities. I would recommend the Hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to Jersey.",4
"The rooms are located in the new part, and are spacious but without character. You've got all you need, but the room could be anywhere.   The beds and pillows are very hard, and the room has individual air conditioning unit, one of those blocks on wheelies.   Staff are nice and helpful, breakfast is good and plentiful.   The spa is very good, but to get there you need to walk through the lobby in your bathrobe, not pleasant.  The killer are the steps to the hotel. If you are on foot, you will need to climb up to get to the hotel. ",3
"The hotel is beautiful . Good size rooms and fabulous pools . However the breakfast is always cold and not great .  The staff is just ok , they will do what we ask but no one understands the meaning of the extra mile . Had a fantastic facial and back massage in the hairdresser and beauty salon within the hotel . It was the best beauty treatment I have ever had with a lady called Frances . ",3
"First time in Hotel de France was back in 1957 !  Thats a long, long time ago! I remember it well and the classic elegance has been updated over the years to maintain and provide the luxurious comfort todays traveller expects. Several bars and restaurants, large spa and swimming pool of the highest standard. Super breakfast menu. Within reasonable (10minutes) walking distance from the centre of St.Heliers shopping and business centre. (When in town, well worth a visit is the Victorian marked.) As well suited as a family holiday or a most comfortable business meeting hotel. You can't go wrong.",4
The hotel has a lovely entrance and great staff. The rooms are large which was nice after the smaller London rooms. The room doesn't have a safe but seemed safe enough. I loved the sound of the seagulls in the morning. The breakfast buffet was good although I can't say I liked the black pudding! We were visiting friends so didn't get to maximise our stay. On the last day we found the pool and spa area which looked great and will be something I plan to make use of on the next visit. My husband said that the gym was great. My only complaint is that the bed was a tad lumpy otherwise a great place to stay.,4
"Staff great but we had no air con and the room was extremely warm for our 5 days. Guess some go to Jersey for the better weather so heat can be expected in summer?? Dont expect lack of aircon from a 4 star hotel in such a location.  BUT Its clear that some rooms DO have aircon so beware what you get.  Also, I emailed hotel two weeks prior to stay to get a view over St Helier from high up...no reply from hotel and we got a room at the back overlooking a corrugated roof.. so not impressed with customer services. This is a hotel for those wanting  a quiet time..which is reflected in the entertainment which is subdued to say the least as is the audience in general. Ive never known bars so quiet when the entertainment is on. Thank god the kids there had free wifi to keep them happy…",3
"Just had  a week at the hotel in jersey. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating and really looked after my wife's elderly parents. Restaurants were lovely, service faultless and rooms very adequate. Thank you De France for making our stay so effortless",4
Just back from a week long stay at Hotel de France and I was very impressed. Be aware that not all rooms have views (ours included). Our room was to the back of the hotel and had no view but it did have a little balcony with a table and chairs on it. There was air conditioning in the room which we really needed as we were there during a very very hot spell. The room had a double and single bed and was very spacious and airy. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant especially Barbara at reception - you won't meet a nicer person. Breakfast each morning was plentiful and there was a good choice. The leisure facilities were great and we enjoyed using the pool area. There are plenty of sun loungers outside and around the pool. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as the food…,5
"Stayed here i the middle of a holiday in France.  The reception staff were very helpful, & upgraded us to one of the new rooms in the spa wing. Room was great with a balcony looking down onto St.Helier. We ate on the terrace twice, food was excellent, if a bit pricey, but par for the course at hotel restaurants! One of the main drawbacks is the distance from the town centre, walking down is ok, but it's a £7-8 taxi fare back to the hotel.  Overall a very good hotel, but make sure you get the best deal online?",4
"The staff throughout the hotel were fantastic. We stayed in a spa room and had two huge doors where you could just about see the sea from your bed. A shame there is a huge medical centre in front of it (worried us when we first pulled into the hotel!) but the actual building is lovely and the spa etc is a real bonus - a great selection of pools/steamroom/sauna/plunge pool/massage pools etc. Great for when the wind got a bit too much on the beach!  We had a lovely stay here, the staff were super helpful and really made it for us. The rooms were lovely and the food in the hotel was surprisingly good. A great base from which to explore Jersey but also come back to a bit of room service and a leisurely soak in the spa and pool when we felt like being lazy!  I've already recommended…",4
"Last minute booking and have to say it was brilliant, the facilities were great and the restaurants both served beautiful food. Ate in saffrons which was sublime, if you can try the tasting menu with wine... Michelin star food and drink. The staff are friendly and helpful. The only down side was the breakfast, which wasn't very organised but I can over look it for the rest of the experience.",4
"I was here for 2 nights on business. The prices for St Helier was good in my opinion. The facilities are quite good, especially the gym and pool, I managed to use them one night and really enjoyed them.  I dined at the restaurant both nights and the food was reasonably good. The service was good the first night, but I would say the service was merely adequate on the 2nd night. Overall I would say I did like the place, but for me the biggest down side is the position. I do like to go out for a wander before dinner, but this hotel is just too far away for my usual early evening jaunt, kind of annoying really because I don't like to eat in the hotel diners every night. Still, not a bad place and decent value for money.",4
"What a beautiful chateau - shame they have had other buildings erected in front of it and it is about 15 minutes walk from centre.  However, they do have an amazing Spa and continental type Wellness centre with Hot and cold plunge pools, steam room and lreally good swimming pool with massage pool as well!  Just the place for indulgent relaxation.  The Spa upstairs was expensive but exceedingly high quality - I had the best foot massage of my life there and could happily have been carried to my room!!!  Most of the bedrooms are dated but they do have very modern rooms available at an upgrade price.  We thought it would be worth it to us.  Nothing wrong with the majority of the rooms, just a bit ordinary.  Confortable and clean and very nice staff.  The front of house manager was…",4
"What a joy a visit here has been. friendly, efficient, attentive but never over bearing staff. (Special mention of young man named Eliot who helped us with our luggage and gave us all the information about the Hotel that we would ever need) The public areas and rooms were spotless and very well maintained. Breakfasts a joy. Spa a real treat. Comfy beds with duvets.I find it hard to find anything negative to say. So looking forward to my next visit.",5
"An impressive, imposing hotel, with great facilities. The staff were polite, helpful, and efficient, and genuinely friendly. We had a wonderful long weekend, and we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5
"My visit was a quick business trip so packed that I can't comment on the breakfast because I had no time to eat it, or the infinity pool and spa which sounded lovely. Setting very convenient and staff friendly. My room was on the top (fifth floor) accessed via a slow lift.  Bed comfortable - the whole experience was a bit like going back in time. I'm sure there are many more picturesque places to stay in Jersey and its a shame the grandeur of the hotel is hidden behind more modern buildings but a good central base, none the less.",4
"The Hotel de France is the place to stay in Jersey !  Spotlessly clean and elegant throughout, coupled with excellent customer care. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and rooms were lovely. The cleaning staff work to very high standards and restaurant staff are friendly, efficient and well trained, always with a smile to give. I particularly liked the fact that there was a very cosmopolitan feel to the hotel with the staff coming from all different areas of Europe. Staff were from Hungary, France, Romania  and several other counties and were all polite and very eager to please.   Well done Hotel de France .... keep up the good work ... I for one will definitely be returning and will be recommending you to others !",5
"Elegant hotel in an excellent position, well enough away from town to be quiet, but also within walking distance of it.  Breakfast was excellent, with a great choice of good healthy food.  The swimming pool, jacuzzi area etc all looked really good, but unfortunately, being on a conference I didn't get a chance to use any of it.  The bedrooms were really lovely, bathroom spotless, and I was lucky enough to get a room with a view towards the sea.    Although nearly all of the rooms were taken up by people attending the conference, I still found it quiet during the night.  Would definitely use this hotel again.",5
"Lovely hotel, beautiful island! I spent 4 nights in the hotel at the beginning of the month with some friends and we were more than happy with the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms, and the helpfulness and efficiency of the staff. Unlike some other large hotels, there was always the feeling that each guest mattered. Breakfasts were delicious and efficiently served, as were the other meals that we took in the hotel restaurants. I would be more than happy to go back to the Hotel de France - hopefully quite soon! :-)",5
"Stayed here for a short break at the end of May.  A very nice hotel, far enough away from the centre of town to be quiet, but near enough to walk to for shops, attractions, night life etc.  Like a previous reviewer, I too last stayed here back in 1976 and was disappointed that the sweeping view had been obliterated by the ugly building in front, but otherwise it fulfilled all expectations.  Breakfast buffet had plenty of choice, including gluten-free rolls on request for which I was very grateful.  Standard room was very comfortable and spacious enough.  Swimming pool was excellent, just wish we had more time to make more use of it. All in all a very nice stay, will definitely be back.",5
"Wonderful Hotel on a beautiful Island. Staff were efficient, courteous and friendly. Nothing seemed to much for them. Saffron is an excellent restaurant with great Asian fusion cuisine. The facilities are excellent and I wish I had taken more advantage of the swimming pool and gym. I would also like to say how appreciative we was of Elliot. He is a credit to the hotel. Again very helpful and courteous and was doing work experience, well done Elliot and I am sure with that attitude, you will have a bright future in the hotel trade.",5
"We first visited Jersey and the Hotel de France 34 years ago on honeymoon and the Hotel was certainly different then. On arrival it was a little disappointing to find the previous sweeping drive and grand entrance had been obscured by a health centre. However, once on the forecourt the re modelled foyer is welcoming and accessible. The hotel is well furnished and decorated with beautiful fresh flowers, yet has a relaxed atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are not large but spacious enough and comfortable and there is still a sea view to be enjoyed. Breakfast is pretty traditional in buffet form but with a sensible time slot for the later risers! There are two restaurants, we used only one which is the more informal cafe style establishment next to the spa…",4
Good:  Kind and efficient staff. Great food with lots of choices. The gym was nice and some quite good machines. Nothing was really bad but some issues that are irritating. One day I didn't get any towels. They left the window open after cleaning. Nice with some fresh air but it was freezing cold in the room and you couldn't adjust the heater.,4
"A lovely hotel, staff cant do enough for you - extra mile is the norm Here for a conference but without doubt would be looking to come back on a trip About ten brisk walk minutes away from a beautiful sea front area with great food bars etc Local pub ""The weliington"" very friendly and reasonable price bar, number of close supermarkets etc",5
I have to say this is one of the best hotels I have had the privilege of staying in. Everything from the staff to the food is spot on.  With regards to the cleanliness of the hotel it got to the point I was going around trying to find dust butt to no avail!! The room we were allocated was situated on the front of the hotel overlooking the lovely patio area.  I think it was room 138. We used the spa every day and it is absolutely spotless and a perfect place to unwind after a day shopping or exploring the island. We had one minor issue with waiting times in the restaurant one night which was sorted by the hotels director of food and beverages perfectly.  This gentleman takes pride in his restaurant and staff and rightly so.  All the staff are a great asset to this place. The walk…,5
"We booked 3 nights in this hotel as a joint birthday treat as we had seen a special offer for both the hotel and the ferry crossing. We didn't therefor expect great things but were pleasantly surprised! A very large hotel but still quiet and calming. The staff were excellent, helpful and attentive although there was an occasional blip when they couldn't understand certain English words. A local work experience lad was detailed to take us and our cases to our room on arrival, I believe his name was Elliot and he was incredibly helpful and gave us lots of good tips for our stay on Jersey. The Pool and Gym were great, visited by us every day. The bedrooms spacious and clean as was the entire hotel. For us the most impressive thing was the 3 course evening meal we had, free, as part…",5
"A four day break exploring the Island. Hotel De France exceeded even our high expectations. Clean, comfortable, fresh flowers at every turn, attentive staff and food of the highest possible standard. The regular shuttle bus down to St Helier meant we had the advantage of being out of the noise of the town, but still all the access we required. An airport shuttle would be a good addition.",5
"We stayed at this hotel courtesy of family who live nearby recommending it highly. Their recommendation was well deserved. From the moment we entered, the service was friendly, professional and helpful. The room was large, had a patio, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Great that no smoking is allowed. The restaurant was very good, food and service excellent. Wi Fi worked well and was free. Breakfast was plentiful and of good quality, service here too was excellent. The bathroom was functional and clean, the bed comfortable. The bar was also comfortable. The very large foyer gave a relaxed atmosphere to the whole organisation. Outdoor areas were beautiful and well maintained, for a large hotel we didn't feel crowded at anytime. When we left, the ordered taxi failed to show but…",5
"We selected this hotel because of a personal recommendation and we were not disappointed.  Although it is a little way out of town, it is an easy 10-15 minute walk and has plenty of free parking.  The room was comfortable and well equipped, with a good view of the gardens and St Helier.  Saffrons Restaurant was superb, an a la carte restaurant with an Indian spices twist to all courses.  we could recommend this restaurant for special occasions, but it is not open every day (not Sunday and Monday).",4
"Very helpful friendly staff comfortable room and good facilities. Only one restaurant open on the Sunday, Monday and Wednesday which meant that the one that was open could not cope. Monday evenings meal took nearly 2 hours for 2 courses and coffee. Quality of food was good, when it arrived.        ",5
Just returned from a week in the hotel. My wife and I were delighted with the style and comfort of the hotel. Everything about it was quality. Impeccably clean and we enjoyed the meals in the restaurant. We had a 4th floor room overlooking the garden and the town. Waking up to such a lovely view was a bonus. All in all we were exceptionally pleased. Some less mobile guests might find the out of town location not to their liking but for us it was a pleasant 15 minute walk into town and 20 minutes (back up the hill). We hope to return.,5
"My husband and I chose this hotel as it gave us the best value compared to some of the others on the island.  We chose a standard room which was bright, airy and clean . . what more could you ask for.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service in the restaurants (both were very good by the way) was excellent.  I used the spa for the swimming pool & steam-room.  A lovely addition to the hotel.  Location is great - only a 10 min walk into town.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4
"Stayed at this hotel, as it was on a offer with secret escapes, and it was soo much better then we expected. Rooms was spacious, nice bathroom, separate room, the only bad thing i could say about the room was the tv, very tiny!  In our package we got breakfast and a dinner one evening. The dinner was a voucher for up to £24.00 per person, we used this at aroma, the scampi is toooo die for here, we definitely do not get fresh scampi like that in London.  The breakfast was also delicious, the food was always hot, and there was such a good selection of food, which was all great quality.   The staff were very friendly, and we never had a problem with anyone.  The spa....WOW not like any hotel spa i have ever seen. Its free for hotel guests :)   whenever in jersey again, will…",4
"Stayed here with my girlfriend for our first time in Jersey, and we are so glad we picked this hotel, from the moment we entered the place had a really nice atmosphere. We had a front facing room which gave us a really nice view over the town and the spa was incredible, really nice and modern and good value for money as you can use all the facilities as much as you want. Breakfast offered a good choice for everyone and the same with the cafe as well for lunch or dinner, only a short walk from town meant that you can always head out if you want a change. All the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, especially Anneleen and Steve on reception who between them were always happy to help to answer our endless questions about the island and the hotel.  Highly recommend a visit and…",5
"I stayed here for two nights in June for a corporate event hosted by Jersey colleagues. The hotel itself is dated and pretty uninspiring yet the prices charged in the bars and restaurants indicate something different. The accommodation is average at best but the biggest disappointment was the poor customer care from the staff. Problems with the booking on arrival, sloppy reception arrangements and an inability for even the simplest financial transaction to be resolved effectively were all annoying. From the fixed wardrobe hangers, to the insistence on having a credit card imprint almost before you enter the hotel, to the crass presentation of a bill for everything at a time to suit the staff, not the customer - all these combined to create a feeling that guests are not to be…",3
"Just returned from a four night break.  What a lovely hotel, spotlessly clean.  Room was a very good size. Towels changed everyday. Breakfast excellent.  Staff very helpful. Would definitely stay there again!",5
"We booked through Secret Escapes and had the most wonderful trip.  The hotel is amazing, large, with spacious rooms and everything spotlessly clean. The food was lovely.  The staff could not have been more helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Everyone we met whilst driving around the island was so helpful.  When we stopped to look at a map a car would stop and the driver offer help with directions. Lots of things to see and do, we're keen to return",5
"we spent 4 nights at the hotel last week. the hotel staff were excellent and the property was clean and tidy. the food was good and facilities were as promised. the spa in particular was very good.  our room was again very clean and was maintained as such by the cleaning staff every day, the only issue for me was the pillows were very firm!!   we found that the car parking was fine and the position of the hotel on the ring road made escaping st helliers traffic for the country was quick and easy. bit of a walk into town from the hotel but they put on a bus 5 times a day so you can get in and out if you do not fancy the walk. its a pity they do not put the bus on in the evening.  excellent stay and i would stay there again and believe me i am fussy!!",5
"We stayed for 6 nights, during the Jersey Motoring Festival, and couldn't fault it.  The food was lovely, staff attentive and friendly, and the facilities were all we could want.  Nice bars and seating areas indoors and out to suit all weathers, with loungers on the lawn when the sun shone.  The breakfast was particularly high quality I thought.",5
"Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights in a double room. The hotel has a good amount of parking but location is 15 minutes walk at least from town center. Building looks very nice from the outside, grand and french looking. Decor inside is dated and really needs to be updated.   Double room is an ok size, but the bed is hard and uncomfortable with flat hard pillows and the duvet cover is too thick and heavy. I also got very ichy from the sheets, maybe it was the detergent they use. Beds are also too small. It was a double, which for two people, you need at least a queen to be comfortable. Bathroom is ok but needs a serious update! The worst thing was the noise. Walls are thin and you can here everything anyone is doing upstairs, outside the room or in the rooms next…",2
"Visited twice in the last couple of years. I recently stayed when the recent boat show was on in St Helier.  The Hotel is recomended, nice gardens, great staff, nice food and the Hotel is clean and well presented.  I will be back !",4
"This is a large fairly rambling hotel undergoing some building changes. Pleasantly this does not impinge on the areas not subject to change. There are several restaurants and bars catering for all  tastes. The outside terrace is a good space. The entrance hall is airily impressive and the pools, sauna and gym etc are excellent. Rooms are spacious with effective showers. The downside for mine was the absence of air con. Staff were friendly and helpful.  The hotel is situated about a mile from the centre. There is a shuttle bus into and out of the centre which, sadly, is insufficient in terms of demand, frequency and start and end times.   We had a bargain rate and as such presented very good value for money. Rating would be between average and very good, tending towards very good.",3
"We found all the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly and showed a genuine interest in ensuring we enjoyed our 4 night stay. The Hotel is of a very high standard and you can see that a great deal of attention has gone into everything. The Spa facility with its swimming pool, gym and all its other facilities is superb. One of the very best we have ever come across in any hotel. Nothing has been scrimped and it is a real credit to its designers and builders. It is very large but does spoil the views from the first floor spa rooms. The Spa Rooms are again excellent, very modern and may not suit everyone, but we really liked these. The bathroom again is huge with a superb walk in shower and one of the deepest baths we have seen. A safety rail here would be advisable for elderly…",5
"From the moment we pulled up in the car to the minute we vacated, It was just a great experience,the hotel staff were fantastic, everything is catered for, our room was spotless with a great view over St Helier, on my wifes birthday we ate in the Saffron alacarte restaurant which was impecable, never have we eaten such good Indian/style food. The Spa was out of this world and available to all residents. Can not reccommend this hotel enough.  Going to return soon.",5
"Based on the recommendations here, we decided to try the tasting menu at Saffron and we were not disappointed.  From the delightful amuse bouche at the start, to the wine flight and the chocolate, ice cream and rice crispy cake pudding, the dishes were original, fresh and absolutely delicious.",4
"We  booked this hotel/package through Secret Escapes and were 100% satisfied with everything. The hotel is better than any we have stayed in in the UK. Although it is a large hotel the service and facilities are truly 4*. The breakfasts and evening meals are excellent, staff helpful and friendly, rooms very clean and comfortable. The hotel is a short walk in to town (10 mins max) car parking is easy and grounds lovely to sit in and sunbathe or just relax. The spa was also worth a visit. A very enjoyable break and Jersey is fab!",5
"Booked through 'Secret Escapes' after another break fell through. Hotel is really excellent although some distance from the town centre. Reception staff were cheerful & friendly. The room was a good size, very clean. We used the restaurants in the hotel & they were both excellent.",5
Steep hill from town a 20 min walk. Too far for us so £6 taxi fare each way. Would book a hotel nearer civilisation next time. No minibar and hair dryer needed an upgrade. Television tiny! Reception staff could be better informed would not return.,3
"Very nice hotel indeed. Stayed here for 2 nights, although the reason for visiting Jersey was to attend the funeral of a very dear relative. The hotel itself is impressive, very big, but not impersonal. The rooms clean and comfortable if quite basic. The staff were helpful and pleasant. The breakfast was good and plentiful.  The health spar was great, with a nice pool, sauna and an excellent steam room  The location is not ideal, being  a bit of a stroll to the town centre  and on a slope, so would not be great for young children or the disabled. However, there is ample car parking here.  I would recommend and certainly stay here again",5
"I booked this holiday via Secret Escapes. I emailed the hotel to request a nice room as it was our anniversary. I received an immediate response asking if it was a special anniversary - I replied stating it was not. I was really touched to find flowers and a fruit platter in our room. Our room, on the second floor, had been recently refurbished and was compact but clean and comfortable. There is free wifi throughout the hotel - should be standard by now but is sadly lacking in many other establishments. The walk to town takes around 15 minutes - there is also a courtesy bus laid on by the hotel. Breakfast was plentiful and included items to order, the usual hot and continental buffet along with  A delicious selection of fresh fruits and Jersey yoghurts. The pool is incredible…",5
"We have just returned from a last minute booking after our overseas trip was cancelled by Air Strikes in Croatia!  The hotel is excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. The reception area is stunning too. We ate in the Aroma restaurant 4 times and had lovely meals each time.  Our double room was on the 9th floor with a distant view of the sea and it was very clean and comfortable.  There was a small table with 2 chairs which was good as sometimes hotels only seem to think you need one chair! Our only complaint would be that we had the smallest t.v. that we have seen in a hotel room for a long time!!!!   It is about 15 minute walk down to the town, but there is a good bus service from the town centre, but be warned if you want to catch the last bus back to the hotel it…",4
"I last stayed here 32 years ago and did not have high expectations, how wrong was I. This place has changed beyond all recognition. Yes the original building is still there but it has trebled in size. We booked through Condor/Travelsmith holidays. On arrival we weren't on the system due to confirmation not being sent by Travelsmith, the type of room we had requested was fully booked so without hesitation we were offered a junior suite. Room 323, we could see the sea in the distance and the room was lovely, big bed, big tv, settee, chair and vanity unit. Steven the porter deserves special recognition as an extremely helpful and polite member of staff. The spa and pool were wonderful, all the restaurants were lovely with the food being of a very high quality. Car parking on site…",5
"We have just got back from a weekend conference held at this hotel and had an excellent time there.  Service throughout was first class even with the pressure of having so many conference delegates staying there.  The bedroom was of a good size, even if the view from the bedroom window of the roof of the conference centre was not marvelous. The decor was good and the rooms were spotlessly clean.  We enjoyed meals in two of the in house restaurants and had very good service.  We also enjoyed a facial and massages in the spa and can thoroughly recommnd these. One word of caution, the was a planning application notice to say that the conference centre and one wing of the hotel are to be pulled down to be replaced by flats.  This is likely to cause substantial disruption so if your…",5
Have just returned from a conference at the Hotel de France. All the staff were extremely helpful. Registration & check out were quick and smooth. They served 400 of us for a conference dinner which was served promptly with no table having to wait. The service was excellent The plates were hot and the food looked & tasted delicious. The bedrooms were spacious & clean; I am glad we did nt pay the extra for a sea view as it is a very distant one! One the first night we had the set menu which gave a choice of three dishes for each course. The portions were quite small so I asked for extra vegetables. A bowl of ratatouille and one of green vegetables were served without any additional charge. As we were only there for 2 nights I did nt have time to make use of additional facilities.,4
"We recently stayed at this hotel as part of a large conference party.  We arrived very late (delayed flight) on a Friday night and left immediately after lunch on a Sunday, so did not spend long at the hotel.  However, on the whole we were modestly impressed.   The hotel was clearly once a very imposing building, but there has since been a rather awkward 'seventies-style' block of car parks and doctor's surgeries and offices built directly below it, which means that it is all but masked from view unless you are either further than 100 metres away or within a few.  This is a shame, but many such deeds were done around that time and it is not the end of the world.  Reception staff were very helpful, as in fact were all the staff all of the time that we were there.  The room…",4
We have just returned from an excellent 4 night weekend at a comfortable hotel well located and was topped by the superb meal at the hotels Saffron restruant that served unusual subtly spiced Michelin starred food and service.,5
"We had an overnight stay at this hotel last Saterday and it was brill, staff (from reception to waiting staff to porters) were very attentive and professional. Dinner in the Cafe Aroma and terrace was great as were the guys that served us. The room was lovely, big enough for 4 people. and the view was over St Helier :) On Leaving we found a car with a flat battery...the staff were so helpful and soon got us up and running.... Can't wait to stay again :)",5
"This was our first trip to Jersey and we simply loved it. The island is stunningly beautiful, the people courteous, welcoming and helpful; and the history of Jersey truly absorbing and fascinating.  Hotel de France capped off a wondersful time on Jersey.  From the moment we stepped across the threshold, the staff could not have been more friendly. They were all highly professional and nothing was too much trouble. The facilities are of a high standard and the hotel is beautifully maintained. Our room was larger than one might normally expect and very comfortable.  We had a lunch and a dinner in the Aroma Bar and it is to be recommended. The food was very, very good, as was the choice of wine. Service was of the highest calibre.  Highly recommended.",5
"We stayed the the Hotel de France for a weekend. The facade of the hotel is beautiful and grandiose, even if surprisingly hidden by a hideous car park.   The rooms however are pretty basic, they look like one of those 2* and 3* hotel (usually part of hotel chains) in the outskirts of many towns. Nondescript, basic decor.   Staff were friendly and breakfast is ok. Breakfast starts at 7am during the week so if you have an early flight it is unlikely you'll get any breakfast at the hotel.",2
"We only stayed one night here - a quick hop to Jersey for my mother's 92nd birthday. The hotel provided adjoining rooms - requests not always facilitated when booking online deals! Rooms were clean, sea facing albeit over the roof of the Orangery and I'm sure at one time the hotel would have looked very impressive as you drove up before the view from the road was spoiled by the Health Centre being built. There was a very convenient disabled parking space for us just outside the entrance - undercover parking for other guests must also be noted as a boon. Away from the main part of St Helier it is obviously a fantastic choice for a spa weekend - we weren't destined to use that on this occasion but would certainly consider it for just a couples weekend another time.  We would…",4
"Myself and my partner have just returned from a lovely three night stay at this Hotel. All of the Staff were very helpful and attentive and the Hotel itself was definitely Four/Five Star. The room,  pool, restaurants and Bar area were all excellent. The Breakfast was plentiful and the hotel is a perfect base for touring Jersey. If you do find the walk up the hill too much after a nice evening out or after a large meal in one of the many excellent Restaurants in St Helier, local Taxis were all very cheap! I would recommend this Hotel to all and will definitely consider it again when I revisit Jersey. Overall we had an excellent three nights here and I thank all of the staff for making it so.",5
"have been to Jersey many times. first stay at De France.would return. stayed 2 nights for a getaway break.  spa and pools very relaxing and clean, as were the changing room etc... massage on last day was sublime. sea view room quiet. slept 12hours one night,my normal is 6/7hrs. hotel is a 15 minute walk from town tho there is a curtesy bus. delicious food in aroma bar and great service. one complaint, my cooked breakfast took 35minutes. and it wasnt busy!",4
"Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions now and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Rooms pleasant, staff very friendly and helpfull. Leisure/Spa facilities top class, can see why it won an award. Excellent breakfast served in the mornings, bistro open all day and a choice of restaurants in the evening. The only negative is the location as it sits high at the back of St Helier, however they do run a mini bus down to the town centre at regular intervals Monday-Friday. Car parking on site usually not a problem. Believe it's very popular with families end of July, into August and September with kids club/creche on offer plus a variety of entertainment for the adults. Great deals available off-peak.",4
"We stayed here 3 nights and had a lovely stay. The rooms were clean and not huge, but more than adequate.  The spa area was fabulous, bathrobes in your room to go down to the spa in so no need to change anywhere. The pools were clean, and never really busy, even on the Saturday when the hotel was busy, there were still beds in the spa area and no pool was ever full.   The steam room and sauna were also great.   The breakfast was a real treat, we wanted for nothing but never ate in the restaurant as the prices were a bit expensive.  Good position for walking into St Helier where there were some lovely places to eat and drink.  The reception staff, especially Fay were very helpful and she went of her way to assist us with the one way traffic system !! and recommended places to…",5
"I stayed here overnight on business last month and thoroughly enjoyed my stay, in fact I could cheerfully move in here and leave everything else behind! The hotel has a lovely atmosphere, a bit like stepping back in time to a more opulent era, it was great. I travelled with a colleague and we ate in the hotel, we both had the fantastic fish & chips, which was a selection of lightly battered fish cooked to perfection. Following this we retired to the bar where we had a very enjoyable evening, the barman - I think it was Richard - was very entertaining. Breakfast was super with a selection to suit every taste.  Regarding the room, it was so refreshing to be able to have a lovely deep bath which didn't take hours to fill, lashings of hot water and gigantic bath sheets. This hotel…",5
"Spent last Friday night at the Hotel De France and had dinner in Saffrons restaurant.  They serve the best Indian food in Jersey it was amazing.  We had a package deal which gave us a three course dinner in Cafe Aroma but swapped this for dinner in Saffrons and are so glad we did.  The food is truly delicious and the restaurant and service were great.  Can't wait to go back.  The room in the hotel was lovely, no view but this didn't matter as we were just there overnight.  Fantatsic breakfast and we could have used the Spa but didn't get round to it.",5
"I stay in this hotel every time I have a business trip to Jersey by choice.  The hotel location is within walking distance of the beach and Saint Helier town however taxis and buses are frequent if you prefer.   I always get a great welcome from this hotel and in fact all staff are very pleasant and accommodating.   I usually stay in the older rooms but I prefer these are they have a great view of the town and you can see the sea from some of the rooms. Only downside is they are a little cold in the winter but they can provide you with extra heaters and blankets.  The food has never disappointed and the breakfast buffet is great with a very wide choice if continental and full English.  The spa is amazing! There are 2 swimming pools, one with massaging jets and also cold and hot…",4
"Hotel de France has many outstanding features and some weaknesses that would be easy to rectify. I was staying for business reasons so the location suited me well. For those wanting a beach holiday, the sea was about a 20 minute walk, but town is an easy 10 minute stroll. The staff were generally helpful and friendly and some really put themselves out to ensure guests felt cared for. My room was clean, spacious and adequately equipped. I personally found the bed hard and didn't sleep well....but beds are a very personal thing and others may find them fine. The  disappointment of the room was the television, far too small and with a poor,picture. When you are staying on your own for the week, a good TV is an important companion. The Spa is simply wonderful.....a gorgeous place to…",4
"My wife and I returned to this hotel after 28 years for the first time when we came as a couple in our first year of meeting. We returned to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We expected things to be different after all those years. We were not disappointed as the rooms are comfortable with everything you need, staff are friendly and helpful. We decided to try the Aroma cafe for our first evening meal and the food was fantastic so we returned the following two evenings. The only negative I would say is the location of the hotel which is on the outskirts of town and takes about 15 minutes to walk in. However, once we discovered the hotel shuttle bus into the centre that problem was resolved. W enjoyed our visit so much we plan to return in the near future.",5
"Staff who are a credit to the hotel.  Food that was of a high standard, well presented and of good value . We arrived on Friday for a three night break with our adult disabled sons.  The first indications were not good as we were warned that the hotel was holding a black tie boxing night and that our rooms at the front of the hotel may suffer from some noise.  We were offered alternative rooms elsewhere which we accepted which were fine.  Hotel was wonderfully clean.  Towells replaced daily. Rooms at the front were not as nice as those at the rear.  The only poor feature was the old 4:3 TV which I am sure is due for replacement soon as part of continuous upgrading.  The pool and fitness centre is one of the best anywhere and little used.  At least this was the case in February! …",5
"we staid in this hotel for 1 week and cant complain,the room was good and clean. Free wifi which was a bonus,plus our rate was inclusive of the breakfast. We had room service many times and there service is very efficient,food was very tasty and all within a reasonable price.   The spar was the best,we spent alot of time there just chilling out,its all very new. The hotel is about 15min walk to the city centre,the hotel offers a pick and drop free shuttle to the city centre.  overral would stay here again.",4
"My girlfriend and I spent a weekend in February. Very nice hotel, clean friendly and a nice atmosphere, staff very friendly and welcoming, food nice, Restaurant wasn't open but cafe was good, clean and welcoming, Breakfast again staff were smiling, happy and relaxed, food was hot and tables clean and tidy.",4
"My girlfriend and I stayed the night in January.  Overall, could not fault it.  The location is not the best as out of town, not easy to find or near the beach.  There is plenty of parking and you really need to car to get around.  It is not modern, more traditional but is clean and comfortable.  The staff are very well trained, attentive and friendly.  Both our dinner and breakfast were first class - so much choice for breakfast.   We really enjoyed the spa and this was our highlight.  Spend a couple of hours here, as a nice large pool and good facilities.  The room was basic, but had the benefit of an outside area.  We were sad to leave in the end, as really enjoyed.",4
"i had just had a flu jab at the nearby lido medical centre and because it was coming up to my birthday, we thought it would be nice if we could go to the hotel for a cup of tea. we got there and the lovely staff greeted us well and gave us the afternoon tea menu but in the end we had a full meal. The beef burger was superb and detail was put into the presentation with the fries coming in their own little holder that had fake but clever newspaper articles on it. I would recommend it, even if it was a noch pricy but the facillities are excellent and the new extension is very nice",4
"I arrived at the hotel after struggling to actually find it on foot, and was met by an incredibly cold male receptionist claiming that I did not have a reservation, (which is not something you want to hear after a day of delayed flights and lost bags). 25 minutes later after a healthy dose of snottyness, the error was because ""the lady who deals with online bookings doesn't work on Wednesdays"" - not that I cared, all I really wanted was an apology or, at the very least, a smile..  After a long, creepy and dated walk to my room I entered into a deeply uninspiring single bedroom which was bare of anything made in the last 20 years, with a lovely layer of dust on the complimentary biscuits..  So, I don't get what the below rave reviews are for, but I know that I was walking through…",2
"The hotel was very nice, the pool and spa facilities were excellent, the coffee shop had a excellent choice of drinks and food, all the staff were friendly and helpful too. The room was good, it was abit basic compared to the rest of the hotel. The food at our ball was very good as was breakfast, very good choice to suit all",4
"Though difficult to find in the dark, as the postcode wasn't recognized on our satnav, the receptionist guided us in on our mobile phone. The hotel is  not visible from the street, as is on the side of a hill, and blocked by buildings in  front!  Exceptionally helpful and pleasant staff throughout. Room was spacious but a bit sparse and small TV and bathroom. 15 minute walk into town, all downhill, which was fine for us, but might be difficult for an elderly person! Best to get a taxi back, as all uphill! The food in the restaurant  was very good, as well as the breakfast. Overall, we enjoyed our short stay at this very traditional hotel.",4
"Stayed on a special locals overnight package for my husband's birthday. Check in was efficient but  I was surprised to be told we had to have dinner at 7pm in Cafe Aroma. We were worried about noise as there was a ball at the hotel in the evening  but our room on the 9th floor was quiet. The room was quite basic with a very small tv. The spa is impressive but you are not allowed a robe unless you have a treatment! I thought this was pretty mean and did not find the receptionist at the spa very welcoming at all. The spa was very busy on a Saturday afternoon and people were waiting for showers. There seemed to be only two. Our dinner was good but there was a very limited choice on our package. There was a good choice for breakfast and service was good. However, some of the food…",4
"The single room was sufficient, albeit a bit tiny. A case rack would have been as welcome as a coat hook. You will miss these: If your coats get wet you don't want to hang them into the wardrobe and cases that always stand around could be enervating. Easy working and free WLAN, daily free hotel minibus to main bus station (with stop[s] en route, e.g. at Snow Hill, check with hotel for times, only two hotels have that on the island, the other was Beausite), superb and helpful service, a breakfast that is truly magnificient.  Look out for their special offers (3 for 2).",5
"*Clean and comfortable room. Bed was tremendously comfortable :)   *Style of room was good as well. Bright, big windows, spacious. The bathroom is beautiful and modern.   *WIFI available in the room.   *Service/Staff was good, fast, friendly.   *The view of the town was beautiful and interesting.    *Good food. Nice portion size, excellent room service choice as well.  *Spa is amazing.   *Had a spa room which had a balcony as well !  Overall,  Superb experience. I highly recommend this hotel for a nice get-a-way, or for the business traveler. Have been to another ""5 star"" hotel on the island before, and the Hotel de France is by far better. :) I had a lovely stay.",4
Stayed for 2 night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Good sized room with comfortable bed and good bathroom. Nice sized bath towels and god quality toiletries.  TV screen small for standard of hotel. Plenty of sockets. Staff from reception to breakfast to bar were very helpful and friendly - excellent in fact. Useful free shuttle service to and from St Helier centre which is within 10 mins walk. Spa - good sized pool with (sadly) lukewarm jacuzzi .  Walk through cold pool for those brave enough! Spa has only sauna and steam room.  Breakfast was plentiful but of average quality - especially the cooked buffet.,4
"A great place, with good spa and pool area.  Fabulous terrace and a choice of restaurants. Helpful staff, good customer service and a really nice dual aspect bedroom (we said it was a special occasion) A short down walk into town with lots of bars and restaurants but a hill walk back!  The hotel do supply a shuttle bus but it was very busy so we just walked the 10 mins. The breakfast was the best we have ever had at any hotel, in fact one our American guests said this is not a buffet its a 10 course meal (and they like food) :D Well worth a visit, we would definately go back with such reasonal rates.",4
"Have stayed here several times due to the wonderful indoor pool and spa. The hotel is clean and comfortable and we had inter-connecting rooms on the third floor to accommodate the children. After the first night we had to change rooms due to an overpowering smell of stale urine - there was no fuss and we were given the rooms next to the ones we were in.  The restaurant we know is over priced from previous stays and Cafe Aroma has a limited menu, that said there are many wonderful places to eat on the island it would be a shame to restrict yourself to the hotel.  Breakfast is well presented and plentiful but a delay ensues for the four slice toaster! The strangest thing is the lack of guests, of an evening the lounge bar and late bar were empty and on the second night the bar…",3
"Great hotel just out of the center of St Helier. The staff are what make this hotel a must if you are visiting Jersey. Limited car parking but you can usually find a spot. Rooms are modern and clean. The restaurant is great but a little overpriced unless it is a very special occassion. Much better value is the bistro style restaurant on the ground floor, same high quality food but much more relaxed and less expensive.",4
"I have had a couple of recent business trips to Jersey and stayed here on both occassions.  Only discovered the spa on second trip.  They claim it to be one of the top 7 in Europe which might be pushing it but it is fantastic.  Large swimming pool with a large spa pool that has a very bubbly section, a mildly bubbly section and a section with huge taps that drench your head.  Only criticism is that there are no seats in that pool.  They have another shallow pool to sit/lay in that is very warm but without bubbles and a final pool of ice cold water that i saw people walking down steep steps into and then up another set out again after the sauna - didnt fancy that myself but rest were great.  The sauna is a good size but the steam room is something else with a great coloured light…",4
"The reception team could not have been more helpful, from advising us on which buses to use, to printing our boarding passes for us, they were excellent. Our room was exactly what we asked for, high floor, good views and quiet. The room was more spacious than other twins we have stayed in, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The breakfast was vast and no shortage of waiting staff as we have experienced in some hotel chains. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful. The courtesy bus to town was invaluable. Definitely 4* throughout.",5
"I treated my husband for a 2 night stay in jersey. We stayed here and from the moment we got there everything was just perfect. The staff were friendly, the room was lovely, with a nice view. The swimming pools were spectacular. We ate a late lunch in the cafe aroma on the 1st day. We chose the option for a sandwich and dessert , which were both lovely. The 2nd night we ate in saffron , it was amazing. The staff were so helpful, very knowledgable about the dishes and wines. We ate from their degustation menu, it was delicious and so well presented. So many different flavours and so much attention to detail. We also treated ourselves to a massage at the spa, I had the most relaxing hot stone massage ever. My husband also, he could barely keep his eyes open for the rest of the…",5
Superb hotel. Brilliant pool complex. Saffrons restaurant was superb. A totally different experience of what you  Would expect from a east meets west menu. So delicate and beautifully presented. The food service team we're very professional and explained in detail what each part of the dish was. They were great. A really lovely evening in beautiful surroundings. Amased it is only 4 star and that saffrons is not michelin starred. Would defiantly stay there again. ,5
"This hotel covered it all : Clean, close to town center, beautiful spa and pool area, great breakfast except the sausages, very friendly and helpful staff. There's an ugly medical center at the front of the hotel which blocks the view of the hotel from the street and a large hill to climb to get to the hotel on foot.",4
"Stayed 3 nights, .......the location is wonderful if you have a car which we did. The staff are without exception welcoming, gracious and attentive.  We ate twice in cafe aroma - see review.  The room was basic but well equipped and a good size. I knocked the cleanliness mark  as our water glasses were not changed or rinsed for the 3 days. The hotel is very big and consists of an older part and a modern extension for the restaurants and spa and gym and bar. There is a lot of walking involved to get around. Older folks might find this an issue.   It is well equipped for large functions such as wedding or conferences.  I did not try the spa but it looks fabulous and he enjoyed the 3 pools while I used the well equipped gym.  Breakfast is full of variety and plentiful. The hotel…",5
"We have just returned from five night stay at this hotel. The staff from the cleaners, waiters,bar and reception are fabulous, nothing is too much trouble. Room was lovely, absolutely spotless, as is the whole hotel. Breakfast is brilliant, so much choice for everyone. Free courtesy bus in to St Helier. The pool is like walking into a warm bath, facilities very good. We were on fourth floor, and at the front of the hotel. Would recommend this hotel to everyone. Loved it all.Bit expensive to eat in the hotel.",5
"Our second visit to the island and this hotel. Just as good as it was 2yrs ago & if anything a little better.  Excellent room, food & bars were very good throughout.Breakfasts are tremendous. The saunas/steam rooms and various pools are a must. The gym? I'm on holiday!",5
"Stayed here this last week , and ad a most enjoyable time. The hotel is very grand with a wonderfully spa and swimming pool. Our room was a standard double which had been modernised. My mum who ad a single booked was upgraded to a double , although it was a dated room decor wise. There was fruit in the room on arrival . It s 15 mins walk to the town. I would definitely stay here again.",4
we had a problem while in Jersey and had to finnd a hotel last min. from the phone book we found The Hotel de France and what a find.This is a top class hotel high up in St Helier.This is not a problem as they run a free shuttle bus to the bus station on the front.Even a standard room is of a high standard and the spa rooms are perfect for romantic stays.The rooms are of a very high standard even to a generous tray of tea and coffees.Being high off the road it is very quiet and relaxing .Have booked for the air show next year as the show can be viewed fron the ballconies cant wait to go back.,5
"I've stayed at the Hotel de France on a number of occasions now, when on the Island for work.  Both times have been with demanding clients and on both times those clients have been thoroughly impressed. Personally, the Hotel pool is amongst the best I've been in.  The waterfall is a nice touch and the presence of an actual plunge pool only adds to the effect of the sauna and steam room!  The large, airy rooms in the new extension are also excellent.  Only slight downside is the service.  Waiters had trouble understanding me and overall standard of service was not the greatest.",5
"We have just returned from a very pleasant stay at the Hotel de France, where we spent four enjoyable nights. First impressions are muted by the ugly Health Centre perched in front of it, and the long, steep walk up to the Hotel itself. This building is quite lovely.  Our room was not especially thrilling, lacking personal touches, but the bathroom was very nice, and I liked that the loo was in a separate room. It's not that the room was bad in any way, just rather uninspired. My bed was incredibly creaky but comfortable.  The Dining Room again is not very charming, the chairs and tables appearing rather utilitarian than beautiful, but we were all impressed by the breakfasts, with a large array of choice on offer. I am a lover of pastries, and found their fruit creations very…",4
"we had 5 nights at hotel de france in jersey all staff at reception hotel bars inside and out and resturants were all very friendly and helpful our bedroom was excellent very big and airy we did like that the toilet and bathroom was seperate in bedroom the breakfast was excellent plenty to choice from, tommy on reception was very helpful and smiled all the time, he arranged some trips for us and also arrange taxis for us, he is a credit to the hotel.we will defintely reccomendthis hotel to anyone we will also be back. our taxi from the airport and back was excellent the little french man was so pleasant.from alan and nina newsome",5
"We stayed in this hotel from 8th August until 27th August (19 nights).On Wednesday, our first room faced the back of the hotel but we asked to be moved and this took until Saturday. Faye the receptionist sorted this out (and lots of other requests too). The second room was light and airy and had a large, .modern tv. There was no air-con, but a fan was sent up when we asked. We had room service one night, which was good but expensive. We ate twice in the Cafe Aroma and although that was dear, it was very good. We had one meal in the Orangery, which was alright but would recommend Ad Lib in town (The Parade) for less money. We asked Faye how much notice we would need to give to check out to go to another hotel (we thought we would get bored after 19 nights!) She said 24 hours and…",4
"Hotel de France is a large hotel with all of the facilities you would expect to boot. Gym and pool an added bonus and with numerous eateries it is ideal for a lone traveller. There is a lot of parking on site so no problem if you have a car or van. Breakfast is plentiful with a choice of cooked/continental and fresh fruit/cereal. I only ate at the orangery and the food was extremely overpriced for what was at best an ok pub meal with extremely slow service. Rooms are quite average, small tv and slightly dated but WIFI was probably the fastest I have ever experienced in a hotel room. Not a bad hotel but atmosphere is lacking.",3
"A large hotel in elevated location on St. Helier ring road, overlooking town but just a few minutes walk from shops.  Hotel has it’s own parking; I took the very first available space as this seemed congested and very busy.   A good welcome at reception, explaining three different dining areas and the two main bar areas, including an impressive schedule of the weeks evening entertainments, usually a choice from a minimum of 3 daily options, including lounge pianist, jazz trio/Quartets, fun casino, magicians and children’s shows.  Poor room experience, I have stayed in rooms with bigger bathrooms. Although the room was serviceable, the hotel has by UK standards, a dated prejudice to the single traveller. This suggests that on the hottest day of the year, it is acceptable to…",2
"Booked the hotel because of the facilities, Pool area & Gym as the weather had been less than stellar & it was something to do in case it was too poor to leave the hotel.  I booked a single room which was plenty spacious.   Great room with extras on the tea & coffee tray. The breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice & the waiter constanly came by to refresh your tea/coffee if needed,  The gym had plenty of equipment all in working order. The pool area was great including the ladies changing room which had everything you would need including hairdryers & a machine to dry your swimming costume. There were approximately 5 pools including a jacuzzi. Also a steam room and sauna. They also included a towel at no extra charge, for your use so you didn't have to take your…",4
"We've just returned from a very disappointing 4 night break at this hotel. To accommodate the over-large hall ways the standard double rooms are very small and sparsely furnished with dated small screen TV’s.  If you decide to stay there don’t eat in the Orangery as the food is pricey and abysmal. Loin of pork over-cooked and too tough to cut, let alone chew, and beef equally tough (at the Sunday evening buffet) and bleeding profusely into in to the sparse gravy , due to not having been rested. I hesitate to suggest that they sack their chef because there was a party of 100 plus Norwegians staying there, all dinning  en bloc at the same time (usually 7pm) so it must have been impossible for any chef to cope. On the plus side (if there was one) the waiting service in the Orangery…",2
"We stayed here for 3 nights.  Room was lovely, bed could have been a bit more comfortable (room 145) at the front of the hotel.  The room was very warm, no air conditioning, but we left windows open all night, and were ok, with fresh air blowing in. The hotel is about 10-15 min walk into St. Helier.   Lovely swimming pool and spa.  We tended to use the facilities on an evening, after a day out.  Very quiet around 7pm onwards. Lovely self service breakfast, plenty of choice.",4
"We had a 5 day break in Jersey.  This was our first stay and the hotel de France came highly recommended by our friends that have been coming along to the hotel for many years.  We enjoyed our stay, the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Cleanliness and service was 5 star.  We loved the pool and was very fortunate to have brilliant weather so it was very relaxing to lay out on the sun loungers.  The staff would be at hand to make you more comfortable with drinks etc.  Room service extremely good. Our  early morning flights were cancelled and they allowed us to stay at the hotel for the day and use all the ameneties.  Oh yes forgot to mention breakfast .... Plentiful and fresh.  Full English , continental, fresh cakes, yogurts, fruits etc.  They all so…",5
"Stayed eight nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The weather was wonderful island magical, cycling superb. We used bikes which meant that we had a short ride from the ferry terminal. The staff were attentive, friendly and efficient. We ate in the restaurants and enjoyed the food that we ordered. Breakfasts we fine and the staff were very effecient. The best part was the spa, swimming pool and outdoor space/ gardens. Our room was OK and spacious but as we overlooked the back of the hotel we did have a rather noisy air conditioning unit ( on the roof) which we needed to adjust to. TV's are rather antique however it was not so important to us...free wifi was excellent!. We tended to cycle into town and it was hardly scenic however this is a reasonably priced hotel with…",4
Wonderful hotel. As soon as you walk into reception you can see how good this hotel is. Spacious and light with an impressive staircase.Room was good we were at the front and it was spacious. Special mention for Faye who rearranged our ferry when we decided to stay another 3 days. Very good value for money and an excellant breakfast. Will definatelt recommend to our friends.,5
"Stayed for three nights during July.  Hotel looks good and staff were friendly and helpful. Spa area including gym and pool were excellent with a good size pool, several extra small plunge pools for whatever purpose, sauna and steam room. Ate twice in the hotel - food and service were very good. Location is fine and is about 10 to 15 mins walk into centre of St Helier. Room itself was small (but bear in mind I have been staying at Liberty Apartments for previous visits to Jersey - these are massive), was right at the top of the building, had no air conditioning and a very small TV (TV size didn't bother me but might bother some). So, in summary, room was definately 3 star, but hotel overall would sneak a 4!",4
"Just returned from 4 day break here, first time to Jersey.  Loved the island and this hotel!  First class service, staff very friendly and helpful, everywhere spotlessly clean, facilities excellent - spa, indoor pool, gardens, restaurants and bars.  Spacious room, excellent bathroom.  Stayed b & b, breakfasts superb.  Absolutely could'nt fault the hotel!  Little bit out of town - 10-15 min walk (downhill) but only got a taxi once due to rain!!  Would certainly recommend to couples, famiiies with older children (although there were younger children there and they seemed to be enjoying themselves) as hotel is a bit quiet (in the nicest possible way!) Only (very) slight reservation - we had no air conditioning, large window to open but could be a problem as weather can be very hot.",5
"Large hotel, large bedrooms, slightly dated decor but mostly in good, clean condition, helpful, friendly service, lovely spa/pool (children have to leave at 7pm and it stays open to 9.30pm), wide choice at breakfast; all pre-cooked and pretty standard fare, though the Orangery restaurant is dark, nice outdoor area outside the spa and the Aroma restaurant.  It is a 15 minute walk (not a particularly picturesque walk it has to be said) into St Helier.  If you want a room which overlooks St Helier, ask for one with a front view.  The rooms at the back have no view and are quite dark.  Our room was about as far from the spa as you could get. The rooms are very warm even though the weather wasn't that hot!  The cleaners come early so remember to put do not disturb sign on if you…",4
"Superb hotel, rooms are very comfortable and large, separate toilet. The service is simply perfect. Wonderful swimming pool (2 actually, with jacuzzi), the ayush spa is gorgeous (I recommend to use it asap, you'll start your break or holidays regenerated), the terrace and the garden are very pleasant. A special mention for the breakfast : the buffet is comprehensive, with local fresh products.   The place is quiet, a bit apart from the centre of St.Helier and on a hill (cyclists, take a deep breath, drivers may use a map because of the ring road) with a big car park (quite hideous but very useful).   We've spent 6 nights there and we missed it a lot when we stayed in another hotel on a beach.  Just a small detail : bigger tv would be welcomed.  Anyway, we will return to this…",5
"The hotel is situated approx 15 mins walk from the centre of St Helier, we found this very easy and flat (left out of hotel then second right past the gasometer and then through Millenium park). The hotel has a feeling of old grandeur, yes our hotel room had no view, but to be honest we were only in the room for sleep and freshening up. The room itself was well appointed with everything you could need and the free wifi in the hotel was a bonus. We used the pool and steam/spa which was one of the best we have seen and the gym looked well equipped. We were lucky enough to have some sun while were were there and the sun beds out from the pool area and onto the grass were welcome. Didn't have any treatments. Breakfast was plentiful, typical buffet style with lots of choices. The…",4
"I booked a 7 night break via a newspaper advert so my expectations weren't great. The first room that I was offered was a nice enough room but the view was non existent. I asked for a different room and was offered and shown a Spa double which I accepted at an agreed surcharge. Even so the view was not great, a very distant view over the St Helier rooftops of the sea.  The room itself was excellent, spacious and well appointed, including two leather easy chairs. There was a small balcony that had afternoon sunshine. The ensuite bathroom boasted a walk-in shower. WiFi reception was good in the room and public areas. The staff were very professional, friendly and attentive. I found the food to be of good quality and the menu varied to suit most tastes.  There was covered parking…",4
"We were really pleased with this hotel for our short break to Jersey. The room was comfortable, clean and very spacious. The breakfast was excellent - a good choice and very efficient service by friendly waiters. Spa facilities were very impressive. We would certainly use it again and would recommend it to anyone.",4
"We have just had a 5 night stay at the Hotel de France and it was excellent!! we had a reservation at another hotel - just across the road (it was awful!!!!) so we had to change hotels on the day of our arrival.  The reception staff are very attentive, both Chris and Tommy need special mention as they were on duty the afternoon we arrived - Chris showed us round the hotel and Tommy took us to our room once we had booked in, and explained about the facilities on offer  We had a spacious room on the 7th floor with air conditioning, bathroom and seperate toilet, a king size bed and single bed for our 4 year old - the weather during our stay was very hot and we made good use of the ice cold air conditioning  The free childrens club was a welcome surprise and addition to our stay -…",5
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel from Fri 10th - Mon 13th August and were generally impressed with it. However, the fact that at the time of our booking it was not disclosed to us that one of the three restaurants was closed on a Sunday was unsatisfactory - if not a breach of contract. It would be reasonable to therefore expect a reduced rate on such days but this was not the case.   In reply to my concern the hotel receptionist stated there was a sign in reception with this information on but that is not the point as we should have known this at the time of our booking. The lack of information in the hotel room compounded this problem as did the fact that most of the restaurants in the trip advisor top ten for St Helier (in August 2012) are also closed on Sundays.",3
"Pros -  Breakfast! The indoor pools opening onto the sunbathing area. Friendly and helpful staff  Cons - No air conditioning in some rooms   Area - 10 minute walk from town centre. Great choice of restaurants (advisable to book on Friday & Saturday). Huge sandy & practically empty beach.  Really great hotel, friendly staff, excellent facilities - spa, fitness room & indoor swimming pools etc. Sunbeds in the garden area with access to the pool, towels available from the spa reception. Good choice of buffet breakfast. Quality of accommodation was everything you would expect, although ensure your room has Air Conditioning as ours didn't and we had to move rooms to one that did!!. Short walk to the town around 10 - 15mins. Courtesy bus to town if needed.",5
"Very good hotel for exploring Jersey. Reception very welcoming and the room and shared areas were very clean. Having parking at the hotel was a plus as it is good to get out of St Hellier and explore the bays, including St Aubins and St Ouens. There are more central hotels in St Helier but it only took 15 mins to walk into the centre.",4
10 out 10 for reception on arrival milk was off in cartons in room. dirty net curtain  dusty top of curtains terriable hard beds couldnot get comfortable  we slepted with the pillows under our backs. Was woken in the night by noisey guests next room left early just got back off to sleep when cleaners came and cleaned that room Then they knocked our bedroom door at 8-23am to clean our room its sunday we would of liked a lie in till 9-15am specially after the terriable night we had  when we went to breakfast i had a lovelly yought and fruit and 2 cups of coffee Cooked breakfast was so cold chef did offer to reheat it.    we never eat reheated food women duty manager should be sacked  we are used to top quality hotels and restarants as i have a honours degree in international…,1
"Basically, this place should be better than it is. A great spa is the highlight here but everything else makes it difficult to say its worth the price. Food is overpriced at the two main restaurants and you can eat far better in town if prepared to walk the 15 minutes it takes. We did that one night but came back at 2330hrs to have a night cap in the late bar...which was shut! Even during the Olympics the late bar was open with tv's on showing the events but nobody behind the bar serving - at least a dozen people came in and left within 10 minutes I stayed for. Rooms are clean and quite spacious but incredibly hot at night unless you turn on the free standing air con unit which makes more noise than a 1920's steam roller trundling through! I'll be staying somewhere else next…",3
"My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel De France on a short break to Jersey. The hotel was exactly exceeded our expectations. The welcome from the staff was very warm and inviting and all staff were very attentive and helpful throughout our stay. Our room was well appointed with a view of the skyline and the ocean. The highlight of this hotel is the swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and the quality of these facilities. The best I have experienced in any hotel in my travels. Breakfast was plentiful with a huge choice and very good quality. We would highly rcommend this hotel and the Island of Jersey for a holiday/break.",5
We stayed for a week between 20-27th July 2012 and generally enjoyed the hotel. We had a decent room but the tiny screen of the TV was so small we needed binoculars to see it! We dined one evening in Saffron the superb restaurant. It is a pity that the standard of food for breakfast was at best mediocre and usually quite poor. The bacon was of a very poor quality every day as evidenced by the white slimey coat that enveloped it. Sausages were equally mediocre and uninspiring and as for the fried eggs I don't think I managed to attain one soft fried egg even when they were 'freshly' brought out to the service area! Tomato juice watered down and grapefruit juice clearly fermenting! For a 4* hotel the breakfast was poor in terms of content and quality every single day. Also note…,3
Nice hotel with good bars and resteraunts room very clean and all staff very friendly and helpfully could do with some more entertainment and livening up of background music but overall good experience,5
"Hotel de France is set back from the main road hidden behind some boring old building, it is also a good 10- 15 minute walk into town. On first impressions I thought it looked soulless, but it has a modern new side, very open plan stairway & elevator to a huge room, a bit plain with a little balcony ( not at all private) probably more for smokers than sitting out on. Expected a lot more extras for price we paid, especially in the bathroom, would have liked more fancy toiletries. Hated the mini bar with the automatic charge as you remove style as you can't use it as a fridge and no-one pays the ridiculous prices they charge, and you can't even look at the goodies to see if worth the money, as you know what happens. Breakfast was very good and lots of choice. The bar lounge on the…",4
"This was our third stay at this lovely hotel and would love to return.   All the staff are so attentative and helpful, cannot praise them enough.      Had a lovely room, spacious and spotlessly clean.    The spa facilities are first class. Breakfasts were excellent with a wide variety to choose from.   Evening meals in Cafe Aroma were of high standard but thought the Saffron restaurant was expensive, compared to other restaurants in St Helier.   We only ate out once and this was at the Ad Lib on The Parade, which was excellent, don't know how they make a profit at the very reasonable prices they charge.    Can recommend the Waverley coach island tour, booked at reception.",5
"We visited in early July and stayed for 5 nights and will be returning! Our double room on the 1st floor was clean, comfortable and the view over the gardens was lovely. The spa is amazing and the treatments we had were just heaven. Breakfast was a fantastic choice of whatever you could wish for and the Saffrons restaurant was truly wonderful. The staff in the restaurant were extremely attentive and very knowledgable and explained each course as it was served. The tasting menu was out of this world and the chef came out after the meal and asked our opinion of the meal. It was a priviledge to meet him.",5
"took my wife here for 5 nights, had a spa room on 1st floor, lovely room, rubbish view, go for rooms on higher floor levels,  Hotel is about 1 mile from the sea, so views are over the town, but you can see the sea if its a clear day, Staff extreemly helpful, service is second to none, room very spacious and with aircon, fantastic bathroom with underfloor heating, Breakfast is a gastronomic feast in the Orangery, but the coffee isnt good, however the food is plentyful and buffet style, with a huge choice, juices, cerials, prepared fruits,continental hams , cheeses,smoked salmon, eggs, fried,scrambled or boiled, sausages,bacon, grilled tomatoes, button mushrooms, baked beans,croissants,pastries,rolls, toast, jams, etc ,  Found in house restaurant menus uninspiring, and when…",4
"Booked a double room.  When I arrived, checked in and got to my room it was a twin with single beds.  No problem, they changed it to a double.  I eventually get to the second room and the view from the PVC window is stunning; bird guano encrusted sloping glass roof and mildew covered concrete.  I wish I could post the photo. And the room smells foysty.   ""Sorry, no other rooms"".  Seems pretty empty to me.    I'd give it a miss if I were you.",1
"Great Hotel.  Was there for 3 nights.  Staff were very friendly.  Hotel is very clean and rooms very comfortable.  Huge selection for breakfast of hot and cold selections.  Ordered room service dinenr and quality was excellent.  About a 10-15 minute walk from the town centre but worth it as the hotel has parking whereas those nearer the centre seemed to have limited options.  Beautiful old hotel with more modern additions, some not so sympathetic to the older architecture but once inside it is a lovely hotel.",5
